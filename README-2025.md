**SPIDER**  (**S**ystem for **P**rocessing **I**mage **D**ata from **E**lectron microscopy and **R**elated fields) 
is an image processing system for electron microscopy. 
**SPIDER** has been in use since 1978 and contains 
over 210,000 lines of Fortran code and 7400 files. The code release from July 2020 (which will probably be the final code release) contains new support for reading/writing MRC files.

The latest release is [available on Github](http://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER/releases). 

* Uses:
     Toolkit for algorithm development.
     Averaging of single particles.
     3D reconstruction from projections.
     Multivariate data analysis.
     Object segmentation from volumes.
     Electron tomography.
     Object segmentation from volumes.
                    
* Features:
     Interactive command line interface
     Hierarchical modular design for scripting.
     Graphical user interface, Web, for visualizing and interacting with images.
     File format interchangeable with other scientific imaging softwares.
     Extensive documentation of operations and techniques.
     Includes executables and source code for use on Linux.
 
* History:
     Originated in 1978 at the [Wadsworth Center](http://www.wadsworth.org) in Albany, NY by [Joachim Frank](https://joachimfranklab.org/joachim-frank) who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering cryo-em research done at the Wadsworth Center.

    In addition SPIDER is dependent on the Fourier package [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) by M. Frigo and SG Johnson.  

    SPIDER has often been used in conjunction with other software e.g. the [iterative helical real space reconstruction methods](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2006.05.015) developed by Edward H. Egelman. 
             
    Maintained since 2007 by: ArDean Leith & [Tanvir (Tapu) Shaikh](mailto:tanvir.shaikh@umu.se).  During these 16 years they have added numerous operations, procedures, parallelizations, and over 500 pages of documentation.  No significant contributors other than Leith, Shaikh, Kischenko, and Kennedy since 2007.

    In 2024-2025 we are happy to see that citations of the use of SPIDER continue to occur in the methodology sections of significant new research publications.
