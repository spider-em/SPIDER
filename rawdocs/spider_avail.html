<h1><b>&nbsp; OBTAINING SPIDER &amp; Web</b></h1>

<hr>

<p> The distribution consists of two separate modules, SPIDER and
  <i>Web</i>. The SPIDER module is written in Fortran and is used for
  mathematical manipulation of images and their contents. The <i>Web</i>
  module is written in <i>C++</i> or in <i>Java</i> and is used for visual
  display and interaction with images created by the SPIDER module or to
  be used by SPIDER. 
 </p>

<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> We regularly run SPIDER/Web on 
  Intel 64 bit Xeons running Linux and AMD  64 bit Opterons running Linux.  
  <b>Note: We phased out support for OSX during 2014.</b>

  Our current standard platform is a Multi-Core Intel based
  machine running SUSE Linux. Heavy computations are done in parallel 
  on a cluster of such machines.  SPIDER requires at
  least 512 Mb of memory.</p>  

<p><strong>On Linux, and other Unix machines:</strong> 
  The current SPIDER and <i>Web</i> modules contain precompiled 
  executables for: Linux - 32 & 64 bit AMD and Intel  platforms.  
  The modules also contain all source code, and sample
  <i>Makefiles</i> for executable generation on various GNU-Linux
  architectures, OSX, and for IBM systems running AIX.
</p>

<p><strong>On Other systems:</strong> 
  In historical times SPIDER and <i>Web</i> also contained  executables for
  Vax VMS, SunOS, Compaq (Dec) Unix, SGI Irix, SGI Linux (for Altrix), OSX,
  and Windows.  These architectures are no longer supported.
</p>

<p><strong>Compilation and linking:</strong>
  One of the SPIDER/Web executables which we
  supply will probably run on your machine.  However the code may have to be
  recompiled and linked for use on some machines. Such compilation will
  require familiarity with your local operating system and compiler to set the
  necessary compilation/linking flags and libraries.  Compilation of
  SPIDER requires a Fortran 2002 compiler.  We currently use both PGI and
  Intel compilers.
  Compilation and linking of Xwindow <i>Web</i> requires a <i>C</i> compiler and
  Motif/X-Window libraries.  The standard <i>gcc</i>
  compiler works well. You may be able to <a href="faq.html#viewimg">view</a> 
  SPIDER format images without installing <i>Web</i>.
</p>

<p><strong>Copyright:</strong> Most of the source code in SPIDER and <i>Web</i> is  
  <a href="copyright.html">released under the GPL License</a>.</p>

<p><strong> <a href="spi-register.html">Download:</a></strong> 
   After registration, you will be given links to download 
   the currently available releases of SPIDER.
   If SPIDER is not available via that link the last release will
   continue to be available from:  
   <a href="https://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER/releases">
                    github.com/spider-em/SPIDER</a>.
</p>

<p>You should also view the SPIDER/WEB documentation which is accessible through the
   Wadsworth Lab's home page 
   <a href="spider.html">http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc</a> or inside the
   distribution which will continue to be available at:  
   <a href="https://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER/releases">
                    github.com/spider-em/SPIDER</a>
