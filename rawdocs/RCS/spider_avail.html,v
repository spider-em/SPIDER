<h1><b>&nbsp; OBTAINING SPIDER &amp; WEB</b></h1>

<hr>

<p> The distribution consists of two separate modules, SPIDER and
  <i>Web</i>. The SPIDER module is written in FORTRAN and is used for
  mathematical manipulation of images and their contents. The <i>Web</i>
  module is written in <i>C++</i> or in <i>Java</i> and is used for visual
  display and interaction with images created by the SPIDER module or to
  be used by SPIDER. 
 </p>

<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> We regularly run SPIDER/<i>Web</i> on 
  Intel 64 bit Xeons running Linux and AMD  64 bit Opterons running Linux.  
  <b>Note: We phased out support for OSX during 2014.</b>

  Our current standard platform is a Multi-Core Intel based
  machine running SUSE Linux. Heavy computations are done in parallel 
  on a cluster of such machines.  SPIDER requires at
  least 512 Mb of memory.</p>  

<p><strong>On Linux, and other Unix machines:</strong> 
  The current SPIDER and <i>Web</i> modules contain precompiled 
  executables for:
  Linux - 32 & 64 bit AMD and Intel  platforms.  
  The modules also contain all source code, and sample
  <i>Makefiles</i> for module generation on various GNU-Linux
  architectures, OSX, and for IBM SP3/4 systems running AIX.
</p>

<p><strong>On Other systems:</strong> 
  Earlier releases of  SPIDER and <i>Web</i> modules also contained 
  precompiled executables for OSX, SGI Irix, SGI Linux (for Altrix),
  Compaq (Dec) Unix, and Windows.  We no longer compile or support these
  architectures.
</p>

<p><strong>Compilation and linking:</strong>
  It is probable that one of the SPIDER/<i>Web</i> executables which we
  supply will run on your machine.  However the code may have to be
  recompiled and linked for use on some machines. Such compilation will
  require familiarity with the local operating system to set the
  necessary compilation/linking flags and libraries.  Compilation of
  SPIDER requires a Fortran 90 compiler.  We currently use a PGI compiler
  on Linux, and IBM compilers for AIX.
  Compilation and linking of Xwindow WEB requires a <i>C</i> compiler and
  Motif/X-Window libraries on your computer.  The standard <i>gcc</i>
  compiler works well.  Please understand that we may not be able to
  assist with problems you encounter running SPIDER/<i>Web</i> on
  machines other than those listed above. You may be able to  
  <a href="faq.html#viewimg">view</a> SPIDER format images without 
  installing Web.
</p>

<p><strong>Copyright:</strong>
  Most of the source code in SPIDER is  
  <a href="copyright.html">available under the GPL License</a></p>

<p><strong> <a href="spi-register.html">Download</a>:</strong> 
   After registration, you will be given links to download 
   the currently available releases of SPIDER.

<h3>DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p><strong>On Linux, and other Unix machines:</strong> The modules 
contain sample Makefiles for compiling on various GNU-Linux architectures 
and for IBM SP3 systems running AIX. 
We provide executables targeted for: AMD 32 and 64 bit platforms,
Intel 32 bit platforms, and SGI Itanium platforms.

It is possible that one of the SPIDER/Web executables which we supply
will work on your machines.  However the FORTRAN and C code
which we supply, may have to be recompiled and linked for use on some
machines. Such compilation will require familiarity with the local
operating system to set the necessary compilation/linking flags and
libraries. Please understand that due to limited staff and
equipment we may not be able to assist with problems you encounter
running SPIDER/Web on machines other than those listed above.</p>

<p><strong>On SGI Irix:</strong> The UNIX SPIDER and Web modules contain
executable versions of SPIDER for use on SGI workstations running
Irix 6.0+ The modules also contain all source code, object
libraries, and makefiles needed for module generation. It is
probable that one of the supplied executables will work fine and
you will not need to recompile.</p> 


<p></p>

<p><strong>Media:</strong> Downloadable from the Internet</p>

<p></p>

<h3>IMAGE DISPLAY WITHOUT WEB</h3>

<p>It is possible to view images from SPIDER on most workstations
without using Web. You could write your own software to do this
using Web as a model. Alternatively you might use the <a href=
"man/cptoraw.html">"CP TO RAW"</a> command in SPIDER to convert a
SPIDER format image to a 8-bit "raw" image. Most modern 
workstations (including SUN) have a native graphics
command for display of such images or conversion of such images
into their own format. If you choose to go that route, you can deal
with basic display functions <em>but cannot easily emulate many
interactive functions such as interactive windowing contained
within Web</em>.</p>

<li><h3>DISTRIBUTION</h3>

   <strong>On SGI:</strong> The UNIX SPIDER and Web modules contain executable 
   versions of SPIDER for use on SGI workstations running Irix 6.0+  The modules 
   also contain all source code, object libraries, and makefiles needed for module 
   generation. It is probable that one of the supplied executables will work fine and
   you will not need to recompile.
   <p>

   <strong>On Linux, and other Unix machines:</strong> The modules contain sample 
   Makefiles,  object libraries, and sample executables for use on 
   various GNU-Linux architectures and for IBM_SP3.  It is possible that one of the
   SPIDER/Web executables which we supply will work on your implementations, 
   however, the FORTRAN and C code which we supply 
   may have to be recompiled and linked on those machines.  Such 
   compilation will require familiarity with the local operating system 
   to set the necessary compilation/linking flags and libraries.  
   Please understand that due to limited staff and equipment we may 
   not be able to assist with problems you encounter running SPIDER/Web 
   on non-SGI machines.
   <p>

   <p>
   <strong>Media:</strong> CDROM or ftp transfer <p>

<li><h3>IMAGE DISPLAY WITHOUT WEB</h3>
   It is possible to view images from SPIDER on most workstations 
   without using Web.  You could write your own software to  
   do this using Web as a model.  Alternatively you might use the 
   <a href="man/cptoraw.html">"CP TO RAW"</a>
   command in SPIDER to convert a SPIDER format image to a 8-bit "raw" 
   image.  Most 8-bit color or black-and-white workstations (including 
   SUN) have a native graphics command for display of such images or 
   conversion of such images into their own format.  If you choose to go 
   that route, you can deal with basic display functions <em>but cannot
   easily emulate many interactive functions such as interactive 
   windowing contained within Web</em>.

SPIDER/Web requires an 8 bit color workstation with at least 64 Mb of
memory.  You should have at least 6 Gb of disk space
for your images. <P>

Recompilation and linking of SPIDER requires a FORTRAN 90 compiler while
recompilation and linking of WEB requires a <I>C</I> compiler and
Motif/X-Window libraries on your computer. <P>

 We can provide SPIDER/Web for either UNIX or Intel NT.    The
software has been developed and tested on SGI workstations.  A few sites
are running it on Compaq (DEC) Unix workstations and one site has some
experience on SUN workstations, but at this time we still advise
running it on SGI systems. The NT version is newly released and is only
in use at a few external sites so far.<P>


<LI><H3>DISTRIBUTION</H3>

   <STRONG>On SGI:</STRONG> The UNIX SPIDER and Web modules contain executable versions of SPIDER for 
   use on SGI workstations running Irix 6.0+ and on Compaq (Dec) for
   Unix 4.0+   The modules also contain all source code, object libraries, 
   and makefiles needed for module generation. 
   <P>

   <STRONG>On  Sun, Linux, and other Unix machines:</STRONG> The modules contain sample 
   Makefiles,  object libraries, and executables for use on 
   IBM_SP3, and Sun Sparc-Stations.  The modules were targeted at 
   SGI workstations and have not been extensively tested on non-SGI 
   workstations.  It is probable that SPIDER/Web will work on non-SGI
   Unix implementations, however, the FORTRAN and C code which we supply 
   will have to be recompiled and linked on those machines.  Such

   to non-SGI machines.
   <P>

   <STRONG>On NT:</STRONG> The SPIDER module contains a sample
   Makefile,  object library, and executable for use on Intel NT 4.0. 
   (Recently one site has used this on Windows 2000 also.)  
   SPIDER has not been extensively tested on NT.  We are able to 
   provide an Intel NT  version of Web that requires Run-time-libraries from
   <I> Nutcracker </I> for
   conversion of the X-Window calls to Windows NT equivalents.  Each
   run-time library copy costs us $150.  Thus, we only distribute Web
   for NT to labs expessing a desire to use it.   At a future date we
   hope to provide a Java implementation of Web taht will run on both 
   Unix and NT platforms.
