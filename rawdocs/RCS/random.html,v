<h3 >Support for MRC data files in <i>SPIDER</i>. </h3>

<p> <i>SPIDER</i> can now load and create MRC format image and volume
    files.  Just specify the  full file name including the extension
    e.g. <i>file.mrc</i> or <i>'file.mrcs'</i>  anywhere that
    <i>SPIDER</i> requests a filename. For MRC stacked images you can
    use:   <i>1@@file.mr</i>. For prompts that request a template use:
    <i>*@@file.mrc</i>. Further information and notes on the drawbacks
    of using MRC stacks are given <a href="./mrc.html">here</a>.

<h3 >The Future of SPIDER Software. </h3>

<p>

<p>It is now obvious that most of the advance in resolution of cryo-em
   reconstructions  since 2013 came from the use of direct electron capture
   cameras and not from reconstruction software improvements.   The report from 
   the 'EM Databank Map Challenge', which I participated in, supports this claim. </p>

<p>However softwares like: <i>Cryosparc</i>, <i>Relion</i>, <i>EMAN2</i>, 
   <i>SPARC</i>, <i>Xmipp</i>, <i>Bsoft</i>, and <i>SIMPLE</i> offer increased
   speed, convenient interfaces,
   and often database connectivity improvements not available  in
   <i>SPIDER</i>.  Due to age and design differences these types of improvements  are
   often impossible to add to <i>SPIDER</i>.</p>

<p><i>SPIDER</i> continues to be used for complete single particle
   reconstructions from microscope frame alignment thru refinement. It can
   yield  reconstructions close in resolution to those from the above
   software even though it does not use 'maximum likelihood' methodology and
   some other advances.  However it will be far slower than GPU accelerated
   <i>Cryosparc</i> or <i>Relion</i>. It also has a command line interface which
   some younger users find old-fashioned. </p>

<p> <i>SPIDER</i> contains software for reconstruction from tilt pair imagery, 
  particle picking,  classification capabilities,  and a wide selection of
  general image processing operations which are not available in these other
  packages.  These methods are valuable for tasks like creating particle masks
  and understanding particle heterogeniety. They are also valuable in teaching
  environments.</p>

<p>What is the future role of SPIDER?   It is already obvious that funding is
not available for upgrades and improvements.  Does anyone out  there care?  
Where do we go from here?  Do you see any continued use of <i>SPIDER</i> in your
laboratory. Please let us know!! </p></p>

<h3> GPU Usage </h3>

<p>The  feasibililty of using GPU's and CUDA for speeding up reconstruction has
   changed significantly since I last described  our efforts.  Recent generations
   of GPU's from Nvidia and AMD  load data at a much faster speed and a
   much larger memory size  is available. It is no longer necessary to create a
   suite of approaches to parallelize different data set sizes and shapes.  
   Implementations in Relion and more so in Cryosparc (using a different  approach
   to alignment search) illustrate the speed-up that is possible.  We should 
   revisit GPU use within SPIDER, but I won't.</dd>

<h3 >The Future of EM Software. </h3>

<p>Both <u>Science</u> and <u>C&amp;E News</u> have acknowledged the current
'revolutionary advance' in  cryo-electron microscopy single-particle 
reconstruction.</p>

<p>These advances in resolution of reconstructions  use new direct electron
capture cameras and publications, that I have seen, utilize
<i>Relion</i> software for the reconstruction.</p> 

<p>I am still uncertain how much of the improved resolution arises from 
the improved software.  At issue are not only the reconstruction
methodology but also the resolution metric. </p> 

<p>If <i>Relion</i> is a significant source of the improvement then there arises a
question of the future role of other softwares in reconstruction.
Currently <i>Relion</i> is able to handle most of the reconstruction  pathway
except for particle selection (windowing) and initial reference model
construction.</p>

<p>These other softwares include: <i>SPIDER</i>, <i>EMAN2</i>, <i>SPARX</i>, 
   <i>Xmipp</i>,  <i>IMAGIC</i>, <i>Bsoft</i>, and <i>SIMPLE</i> and some others. 
   These softwares still contain some capabilities not found in 
   <i>Relion</i>. e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>SPIDER</i> contains software for reconstruction from tilt pair imagery, 
  particle picking,  classification capabilities, 
  and a wide selection of general image processing operations .</li>

<li><i>EMAN2</i> contains widely used particle picking modules.</li>

<li><i>SPARX</i> contains new classification capabilities.</li>

<li><i>Xmipp</i> has an alternative maximum likelihood alignment capability and a
  fairly wide selection of general image processing modules.</li>  

<li><i>SIMPLE</i> and <i>Xmipp</i> (recently announced) contain modules for creating
  unbiased intial reference volumes.</li>

<li><i>Xmipp</i>, <i>Bsoft</i>, and <i>SIMPLE</i> use similar conventions and data metafiles to
  <i>Relion</i> and thus are quite compatible with <i>Relion</i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>With the exception of these capabilities what is the future function of
these softwares?   Will they survive <i>Relion's</i> ascent?  How much 
future development should be done on them?  What will be the impact on 
funding for software other than <i>Relion</i>?</p>

<p>EM Software development funding by NIH in the US is currently in a 
rather bad state.  Both <i>SPIDER</i> and <i>IMOD and its associated software</i> 
have lost major or all of their
funding. At NIH almost all software development grants, for widely
different purposes, compete directly and also compete with funding for
various biological databases.  This lack of targeting leads to poor
quality reviewing. </p> 

<p>E.g. In the case of <i>SPIDER</i> one of three reviewers of our most recent
grant application stated:
<blockquote>"the number of investigators employing SPR is limited and not
             expected to grow substantially".  </blockquote>
It is difficult for me to see how a knowledgeable reviewer could 
come to such a conclusion in the midst of a 'revolutionary advance'.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any viable non-grant mechanism for the
continued  maintenance of scientific "Free Open Source Software". Is it
reasonable to hope that researchers will direct voluntary monetary
donations  to software developers as some have suggested?   Can
researchers even get such a contribution approved by their local grant
administrators?  Do their auditors OK such an unobligated
contribution?  There are additional problems with currency conversion.
Certainly the red tape involved in both donating and
accepting a donation conspire against this idea. Up until now most
software development has  existed as sort of a side-operation of
previously fairly well funded  EM labs, in our case a 'NIH research
resource'.  Such funding is increasingly at  risk and long-term
development and maintenance of software is disappearing.
</p>

<p>This uncertainty in funding confounds discussion on the future of 
EM software.  Where do we go from here?  Do you see continued
use of <i>SPIDER</i> and other softwares?</p>

<h3 >Why no one should use MRC image stacks (IMO). </h3>

<p>
A single particle reconstruction from cryo-EM images of
non-symmetrical objects often requires 100,000 --> 1,000,000 images.
If such a large number of images are stored in most common Linux
filesytems, accession / addition of images will cause thrashing of the
filesytem and extemely slow access.  This occurs not just in processes
accessing the images but throughout all access to that file system.</p>
<p>
To overcome this thrashing one can purchase an expensive parallel
file storage system (e.g. from Panasas) or more commonly aggregate the
images into 'stacks', or a less commonly into a database.  Most EM softwares support some
sort of file based stack. Several different EM single particle 
reconstruction softwares support both MRC and <i>SPIDER</i> format files
to various extents.</p>
<p>
The MRC stack file format is an especially poor choice for your stacks.
There is a single 1024 byte header for the whole stack, then individual images
are concatenated into the stack without any image specific header..</p>

<h4>Problems</h4>

<ul>
   
<li> There is no indicator in the file whether it is a stack or a volume</li><br />

<li> There are no volume stacks.</li><br />

<li> There are no indexed stacks for efficient storage of sparsely
     numbered images.</li><br />

<li> Different softwares assume that the first image in the MRC stack is
     numbered either as image:0 or image:1.  When converting MRC stacks
     to other stacks (e.g. <i>SPIDER</i>) the numbers no longer are consistent
     since they may always start with image:1. </li><br />

<li> The MRC format allows for different XYZ pixel/voxel ordering.  An
     ordering in which stacked images (Z) preceedes the column or row
     value is a disaster if adding additional images to the stack.
     Every single pixel in the stack has to be moved.</li><br />

<li> There is no standard how image data is stored within the data
     field of a MRC format file. For an image some softwares consider 
     the first pixel to be (1,1)  in other software pixel (1,1) is on
     the last line (NY) of the image.   THere is no standard image 
     origin or volume handedness, nor is there any indication of this
     within the file</li><br />

<li> There is no image specific metadata available. As a result:</li><br />

   <ul>
   <li> There is no image density range available.  The range (and
        statistics if wanted) have to be recalculated on each usage.</li><br />
 
   <li> There is no 'valid/used' image flag.  If all images in the
        stack are not in use there must be a corresponding selection
        file of some sort to specify images.  Some software does not
        make use of such a selection file.  An operation which
        operates on a whole stack will often fail when it encounters
        an invalid/unused image.</li><br />

  <li> There is no way to track image accession within the stack.
       A process/operation which fails part way through a stack can
       not be tracked from any info in the stack. </li>
  </ul>
       
</ul>

<h3> Interpolation and Improved Reconstruction Resolution</h3>
</p>


<p>
We recently introduced improved interpolation using FBS 
inside several <i>SPIDER</i> operations. We have shown that FBS gives
significant improvements over the linear and quadratic interpolation
used in <i>SPIDER</i> previously and is as good as the much slower 
gridded interpolation available in 
<a href="http://sparx-em.org/sparxwiki/rot_shift2D/"><i>SPARX</i></a>.  
<p>
During refinement of a 
<a href="./techs/recon1a/Docs/mr1.html#REF">reference based reconstruction</a>
interpolation is used at four steps.  These are:  
creation of reference images from an existing reference volume,  
application of existing alignment parameters to the experimental images,  
conversion of image rings to polar coordinates,
and alignment of images prior to back projection into a volume.</p>
<p>
When we modified our recommended procedure for refinement
<a href="./techs/recon1a/Procs/recon-loop.pam">recon-loop.spi</a>
using the FBS interpolation alternatives in <i>SPIDER</i>
and tested the refinement step using actual cryo-em data we were
perplexed to find a small but repeatable decline in reconstruction
resolution of an overall refinement step.</p>
<p>
We investigated this decline using a ribosome
data set consisting of four sets of noisy experimental images taken
at different defocus levels containing over 6000 images. The
decrease in resolution is caused by the application of 
existing alignment rotation and translations to the experimental images,
before these images are compared to the reference projections for
determination of the best matching pairs.  The 
<a href="man/rtsq.html">'RT SQ'</a> operation  
uses quadratic interpolation which adds an asymmetric filter effect
to the results.  This filtration ended up cutting noise in the
aligned experimental images so that they gave better choice of
matching reference images.  Poorer interpolation gave a better outcome!
But this observation pointed to a method of improving the refinement
step.  We have added a option to denoise the experimental 
images  prior to the reference comparison in the 'AP SHC' operation.
We evaluated Fourier lowpass, averaged box convolution, median
box convolution, mean shift denoising, and anisotropic diffusion
denoising before settling on Fourier lowpass filter as
giving the best resolution results.</p>
<p>
We have modified our recommended refinement procedure to use FBS
interpolation in:  
<a href="man/pj3f.html">'PJ 3F'</a> for the creation of the reference
projections, 
<a href="man/apshc.html">'AP SHC'</a> during 
application of existing alignment parameters to the experimental images,  
and in <a href="man/rtsf.html">'RT SF'</a> for creating the view used for
backprojection.  We also used FBS interpolation
during  conversion of images rings to polar coordinates.
These improvements which are present in 
<a href="./techs/recon1a/Procs/recon-loop.spi">recon-loop.spi</a>
gave a significant  improvement in resolution over the course of a
complete refinement series compared to our previous procedure.</p>

<h3>  Fourier-based Spline Interpolation</h3>
</p>

<p>We have developed a 2D and 3D Fourier-based Spline Interpolation
Algorithm (FBS) in order to improve the performance of rescaling,
rotation, and conversion from Cartesian to polar coordinates.    In
order to interpolate a two- or three-dimensional grid we use a
particular sequential combination of correspondingly two and three 1D
cubic interpolations with Fourier derived coefficients.
A 1D cubic interpolation is a third degree polynomial:</p>                                            

<p>  Y(X)=A0 + A1*X + A2*X2 + A3*X3 </p>                             

where polynomial coefficients A0, A1, A2, and A3 are  calculated from
the Fourier transform of the image: </p>                  

<p> A0 = Y(0)                           <br />                                                      
    A1 = Y'(0)                          <br />                                                    
    A2 = 3(Y(1) -Y(0)  - 2Y'(0) - Y'(1) <br />                             
    A3 = 2(Y(0) -Y(1)) +  Y'(0) + Y'(1) </p>                           

<p>The derivatives at grid nodes were obtained using well-known
relation between Fourier transforms of the derivative and the Fourier
transform itself:</p>

<p>F((d)f(x,y)/(d)x) = i*2*pi*k*F(k,l)   </p>

<p>where  F(k,l) is a coefficient of discrete Fourier transform series
F(f(x,y))</p>

<p>This allows us to calculate derivatives in any local point without a
finite difference approximation involving the data from neighboring
points.</p>           

<p>We compared FBS to other commonly used interpolation techniques,
quadratic interpolation and convolution reverse gridding (RG). A
rotation of images by FBS interpolation takes roughly 1.1-1.5 as long
as quadratic interpolation, but achieves dramatically better accuracy.
The accuracy of FBS interpolation is similar to RG interpolation.
However, FBS rotation is approximately 1.4-1.8 times faster than RG. 
FBS algorithm combines the simplicity of polynomial  interpolation and
ability to preserve high spatial frequency. Currently it has been
incorporated into several operations in the open source package <i>SPIDER</i>
for single-particle reconstruction.</p>

<h3> Optimization</h3>
</p>
<p> Since CPU hardware speeds are stagnant or decreasing there is 
increased interest in optimizing <i>SPIDER</i>'s processing speed.  Since 
<i>SPIDER</i> is a general purpose EM imaging package this means different
things to different users.  Locally the biggest time demand for our
single particle reconstructions is alignment of images with reference
projections  (<i>SPIDER</i> operations: 
   <a href="./man/apsh.html"> 'AP SH'</a> and
   <a href="./man/apref.html">'AP REF'</a>). 

In order to access effect of changes in compiler options I 
used the operation:  
<a href="./man/apshc.html">'AP SHC'</a> which is the latest highly 
'tweaked' version of 'AP SH').  Usual data was a set of 375x375 pixel
images and a comparison of 50 experimental images versus 550 
references.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Compiler choice</dt>
<dd>We have access to both PGI and Intel Fortran compilers.  I choose
    to use the PGI compilers because the Intel compiler produces poorly
    optimized executables for use on AMD Opteron hardware.  The PGI
    compiled executables work well both on Intel and AMD hardware. The
    results reported here are using the current release for
    PGI compiler: Release 11.1).</dd>
<p />

<dt>Optimization Level</dt>
<dd>Aggressive optimization with PGI -O3 gives 3-4% speedup on
    the benchmark code.  However this optimization level can only 
    be used with great care.  Some <i>SPIDER</i> operations give 
    erroneous results with this compilation.  This is probably due to
    differences in the execution order of statements and is a
    problem with floating point data that can potentially have
    wide variations in absolute value of the numbers.  Changing
    order of arithmetic operations like subtract and divide can
    sometimes affect accuracy of the output.  Thus use of -O3 
    can only be justified with carefull testing.  Code for operation:
    'AP SH' is mostly compiled at level O3 now following 
    such extensive testing.  Most non-alignment operations
    are compiled with level -O2.</dd>
<p />

<dt>Kieee FLag</dt>
<dd>Since <i>SPIDER</i> was ported to Linux from SGI I have always used the 
    PGI flag <i>-Kiee</i> which says to strictly use IEEE conventions 
    inside mathematical operations.  Originally I used this in order 
    to get same results from code compiled with PGI as with 
    results from SGI code.  PGI says this flag may slow operation 
    but I am surprised to find that it increases speed of my 
    benchmark by as much as 8%.  Since it is also presumed to be more accurate,
    including use of this flag is a <i>no-brainer.</i>  </dd>
<p />

<dt>Inlining Subroutines</dt>
<dd>Inlining subroutines/functions is expected to increase speed.
    There is less overhead stacking current subroutine data when
    invoking a called function.  However in my benchmark it
    has <b>negative</b> effect on speed, slowing operation as much
    as 10%.  Since inlining is also dangerous as it is tricky 
    ensuring that the inlined code is kept in sync with the 
    actual latest source, inlining is not helpfull.
<p />

<dt>Compiling for Large data </dt>
<dd>PGI compilers have flags <i>-mcmodel=medium, -Mlarge_arrays</i>
    which affect ability of the executable to handle large
    static data and large dynamically allocated data (typical of
    some operations which import large files of data).  Depending
    on how <i>SPIDER</i> is used (particularly if inline/incore files are
    defined) some sites require the ability to handle these large 
    files.  
    The executables distributed with <i>SPIDER</i> have usually been 
    compiled with <i>-mcmodel=medium </i> for handling large static
    arrays.  Benchmarking shows that this has a insignificant 
    impact on executable speed. </b> 
<p />  
  
<dt>Compiling Static vs Dynamic Executables </dt>
<dd>Statically compiled executables do not require the presence
    of certain PGI or system libraries at execution time.  In
    return the executable is larger than a dynamically linked
    executable.  <i>SPIDER</i> has usually been distributed with 
    static executables.  My benchmark shows <b> no difference
    in speed for these two types of executables</b>.  Since
    static executables have far less installation problems over
    varied Linux distributions and ages I have always preferred
    this option.</dd>
<p />

<dt>Compiling for use with OpenMP </dt>
<dd>PGI compilers have flag .<i>-mp</i> for creation of code that
    utilizes OpenMP parallization on suitable hardware.  
    The executables distributed with <i>SPIDER</i> have been compiled with 
    this flag for 20 years. Using all 12 cores of a dual-hexcore
    AMD Opteron gives 905% speedup over a single process on my 
    benchmark.
    </dd>

<dt>Compiling For NUMA </dt>
<dd>AMD Opterons should support NUMA (Non-uniform memory architecture)
    execution when used on multi-processor hardware.  PGI compilers
    have flag <i>mp=numa</i> that would utilize this capability when
    inside OpenMp.  My benchmark shows <b> no difference
    in speed for executables</b> compiled with/without this
    flag on a dual-hexcore AMD Opteron compute node.  Since use of this 
    flag also requires dynamic executables it is not used in
    our distributed executables.</dd>
<p />

<dt>Compiling for use with SSE SIMD Vectorization </dt>
<dd>PGI and Intel compilers have flags e.g.<i>-fastsse</i> which
    allows optimization for use with SSE SIMD. This vectorization
    increases speed on suitable hardware.  The executables distributed
    with <i>SPIDER</i> have been compiled with this flag for several years.</dd>
<p />

<dt>Compiling with Interprocedural analysis</dt>
<dd>PGI compilers
    have flag <i>-ipa</i> allows optimization across procedural boundaries.
    This may increase speed. My benchmark shows <b> no difference
    in speed for executables</b> compiled with/without this

<p> <i>SPIDER</i> can now load and create MRC format image and volume files. 
    Just specify the 
    full file name including the extension e.g. <i>file.mrc</i> or <i>'file.mrcs'</i> 
    anywhere that <i>SPIDER</i> requests a filename. For MRC stacked images you can use:  
    <i>1@@file.mr</i>. For prompts that request a template use: <i>*@@file.mrc</i>.
    Currently any newly created MRC file will contain 32 bit floating point data and the
    first data point inside the file will be at the upper left corner of the image 
    and the top of a volume.</p>

<p> A few operations, especially on MRC stacks, may fail due to the lack of required
    header information such as the current file data range (min and max) or statistics
    (mean, etc.) I suggest you use MRC format only when you wish to pass files to/from other
    software and continue to use SPIDER format within procedures, etc. due to several
    deficiencies in the MRC file format.</p>

<p> The most glaring problem with <i>MRC format files</i> is that there is <b>NO</b>
    standard for how the actual image/volume data is ordered within the file.
    As pointed out by the <a href="http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/mrc_format/mrc2014.php"><i>  
    Collaborative Computational Project for Electron Cryo-microscopy (CCP-EM)</i></a>: 
d30 1
a30 23
  
    <blockquote>
<p> The handedness of the data block is not well defined by the MRC2014 standard.
    Conventionally, many pieces of software have treated the data as right-handed, with the
    origin in the bottom left corner of a 2D image and the Z-axis pointing out of the
    screen.</p>

<p> However, this approach is not universal, and some packages treat the data block as
    left-handed. An example is FEI's EPU data acquisition software, which places the image
    origin in the top left, as documented in appendix C of the EPU User Manual.</p>

<p> Proposals for indicating the data handedness in the file header are under
    discussion, but for now, the only way to be sure of the handedness is to check the
    behaviour of each software package individually.</p>
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>  It appears Relion, ImageJ (Fiji), and now SPIDER expect that the origin and 
     the first pixel in the data storage is at the upper left of the image. This 
     ordering is more efficient for loading an image since file access is efficiently
     buffered.  But IMOD and Chimera expect the origin and the first pixel to be at the 
     lower left of the image. </p>

<h3> CUDA SnakeOil</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Question:</dt>

<dd> Alignment is the major time step in creating a EM single particle
reconstruction and is easily parallelized with many different schemes.
Why aren't GPU's more usefull in alignment of images during EM single 
particle reconstruction?   What is the hold up? These techniques have
been available for five years now and are common in other fields.</dd>


<dt>Answer:</dt>

<dd>
News reports and anecdotes about the tremendous speed increases coming
from application of graphic programming units (GPU's), usually 
involving Nvidia and CUDA, to computing tasks have created unrealistic
expectations.  For some problems GPU's offer great improvement.  
However for some easily parallelizable problems such as alignment  they
lack utility.  Some of the claims about the use of GPU's can even be 
characterized as  'snake oil'.

<p>

Nvidia GPU's vary in their compute capability and the amounts of three
different types of memory which have critical influence on how a problem
can  be approached.  In addition alignment tasks usually take more than
5 minutes of GPU time which means that the GPU can not currently be 
shared with graphics. Thus there must be a dedicated GPU  (often a
Tesla/Fermi board).
</p><p>

Computer science publications and anecdotes commonly report speed-ups 
as the increase in speed of the parallelized portion of the application 
over speed on a single processor.  In usual reconstructions (e.g.
realistic ribosome reconstructions)  significant time is required to
read images from disk. Such input typically occupies 3-10% of the time
during an alignment. If only 4% of the time is spent loading the largest
possible overall speed-up is 25X.  100X is impossible overall.  Another
trick is to report speed-ups from a cluster of GPU enabled compute 
nodes, sometimes with multiple GPU's per processor.
</p><p>

<i>SPIDER</i> and other single particle reconstruction software usually  have
high optimized alignment operations, commonly using OpenMP or MPI.
Alignment speed as tested on our dual-hexcore computer scales very well
with increased number of cores (11X).  Few computers today  have a
single core and a usefull speed-up should be defined in comparison to a
reasonable computer setup not versus speed on a single core.
</p><p>

In EM single particle reconstruction from reference projections using
programs such as <i>SPIDER</i>, there is a  vast range of different  practical
applications.  The number of  experimental images(x), number of
reference images(y), and the size of the images(z), can vary over orders
of magnitudes. E.g.  x=200-10,000 experimental images; y=80-5000
reference images,  z=50x50 - 480x480 pixels.
</p><p>

The gold standard for alignment is still exhaustive search within a
translation/rotation space and the alignment is usually implemented with
Fourier space cross-correlation of polar images. The common  algorithm
has an excess of ways that the processing can  be parallelized. A naive
implementation on a GPU seldom results in more than a 2X speed-up.  Only
by tedious tuning the transfer of  data within the GPU among the
different memories can a speed-up of 12-20X be achieved. 
However a small change in the x, y, x variables mentioned above, or a
change of compute capability in the GPU can completely negate the
speed-up resulting in even poorer  performance than without a GPU.  Such
a change requires a new  implementation.    
</p><p>

It is probably possible to create implementations that will give 12-20X
speed-ups for any specific set of x,y,z and hardware.  However a general
implementation giving such speed-up is currently impossible. Multiple
(10-20?) implementations will be needed for each hardware and the logic
to select the implementation is complex. Each implementation
requires  substantial programming effort.  
</p><p>

Currently reported alignment implementions admit that there have 
been unreported changes (degredationss) in search algorithms or severe 
restrictions on various parameters.  One report gives a rotational 
alignment resolution of only 6 degrees.  Such a restriction makes 
the implementation useless on images greater than 100 pixels.
</p><p>

We can provide a single implementation in <i>SPIDER</i> that can give a 16X
speed-up for specific small range of parameters.  However the overhead  required
to do so including instructions on how to interact with 9 different
run-time libraries for FFT, BLAS, and NVIDIA make even  this minimally
usefull implementation painfull.  When compared to a run on a
dual-hexcore computer this is really only about an effective speed-up of
1.5X!
</p><p>

Currently my advice is to carefully evaluate multi-core computers 
versus GPU enabled computers.  Only if you have a extremely heavy 
compute load involving a single set of x,y,z parameters would it be
worthwhile to go to a GPU solution.  Then you will need software that 
is capable of handling your specific problem parameters. Otherwise split
the  problem among standard multi-core compute nodes.  It probably will
not be much more expensive to do so.  If you still need increased  speed
invest in a parallel filesystem for enhanced disk access (e.g. Panasas
disk array).
</p><p>

This recommendation may change in  the future and I will
revisit this subject when I get access to the new Tesla GPU and
the newly announced CUDA 4.0.

<p>While getting ready to retire a bunch of old SGI MIPS based 
servers and workstations, I wondered how much faster our current 
AMD Opteron 64 bit Linux boxes are than our trusted old machines
of 5-10 years ago.    
<a href="./tips/timing.html">Benchmark table</a>. </p>
<p></p>

<hr \>

<p> 11 Feb. 2009  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArDean Leith<p>

If you are using a Beowulf type cluster for parallel execution of
time consuming operations during single particle 
reconstruction, there are three common methods of parallelizing 
discussed on our website.  Since 
the iterative alignment and defocus group backprojection steps  
typically consume more than 98% of the compute time and are trivially 
parallelizable by defocus group, we commonly use a <i>SIMPLE</i>
<a href="../pubsub/pubsub.html">PubSub</a> script for distributing
jobs to different compute nodes.  Other sites have their own 
scripts to handle the distribution. However if you have a 
inexpensive cluster with <i>SIMPLE</i> Ethernet networking this method
has a large inefficiency when there are many nodes accessing
a single storage disk or <i>SIMPLE</i> RAID array on a file server 
using NFS mounts from the compute nodes. </p>

<p> When many compute nodes attempt to access a single disk (or RAID
array) using NFS there is a significant slowdown in overall through
put.  There is a lot of effort currently to overcome this problem 
with various methods e.g. <a href="http://www.pnfs.com">Parallel NFS</a>. 
However if your compute nodes include adequate local storage on all
the nodes there is a <i>SIMPLE</i> solution that may improve through-put.
At the beginning of a compute node computation, copy all the files 
that are accessed to the local disk with a systems call, then carry
out the computations.  At the end of the compute nodes processing, copy
any altered files back to the file server.

<p>We have recently altered the scripts that we use 
during the <a name="ref" href="./techs/recon/mr.html#REF">projection matching</a> 
step of 3D Reconstruction so that       
<a class="project" href="./techs/recon/newprogs/pub_refine.pam">pub_refine.pam</a> and
its associated procedures (especially 
<a class="project" href="./techs/recon/newprogs/pub_refine_start.pam">pub_refine_start.pam</a>)
handle the cloning of the necessary files on local compute nodes and the
transmission back to the server at the end of the processiong on the compute nodes.
</p>

<p>On our compute cluster this modification is very productive.  The speed 
increase will of course depend on the number of simultaneous processes, and
the pattern of disk access.
</p>
