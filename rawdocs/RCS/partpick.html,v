   <title>Picking Particles from Micrographs</title>

<h2 align="CENTER">Picking Particles from Micrographs</h2>

<hr>

<p>Picking particles from micrographs can be done in several ways:
"by hand"; i.e., interactively using 
<a href="../../web/docs/web.html">Web</a>, or by an automated procedure. At
this stage, the micrograph is normally presented on the screen in a
decimated form: for instance, only every second pixel is displayed,
so that the entire micrograph can be done in one round. The "hand"
procedure results in center coordinates of the selected particles
stored in a document file. The automated procedure (which works
best with globular particles) starts with a low-pass filtered
version of the micrograph or, what amounts to the same thing, the
result of cross-correlating the micrograph with a disk that has the
approximate size of the particle. Peak search then yields, again, a
list of center coordinates of particle candidates stored in a
document file.</p>

<p>The document file can be subsequently used to window particle
candidates from the large, undecimated micrograph file into many
small files. This is done by using a small SPIDER procedure that has a
Do-Loop over all particles and selects windows at coordinates that
are calculated from the stored coordinates, taking into account the
offset (since top left coos are needed by the windowing operation)
and the decimation factor.</p>

<p>Sample SPIDER procedure file (for the case of no decimation):</p>

<pre>
; ----- Parameters -----
[image-dim] = 64          ; Image dimension
[part]      = 1           ; First-particle number

; ------ Inputs -------

[micrograph]mic001        ; Micrograph
FR L
[coords_doc]doccoords001  ; Coordinates document file

;  ------- Output -------
FR L

[win]win{***[part]}       ; Windowed-image template

; -- END BATCH HEADER --

[half-dim] = [image-dim]/2

; Get number of keys
UD N [num-keys]
[coords_doc]

; Do-loop running over index = key
DO LB1 [key] = 1,[num-keys]
    ; Unsave document, in-core, key, x-coord, y-coord
    UD IC, [key],[xcoord],[ycoord]
    [coords_doc]

    ; Compute top left coordinates for window operation (WI)
    [topleft-x] = [xcoord] - [half-dim]
    [topleft-y] = [ycoord] - [half-dim]

    ; Window
    WI
    [micrograph]             ; INPUT: micrograph
    [win]                    ; OUTPUT: windowed-image template
    [image-dim],[image-dim]  ; image dimensions, in x,y
    [topleft-x],[topleft-y]  ; top-left coordinates

    ; increment particle number
    [part] = [part] + 1
LB1
; End loop

; Close in-core document file
UD ICE
[coords_doc]

EN                       ; end of SPIDER procedure file
</pre>

<br>
<br>
 

<p>Examples for more sophisticated procedures, taking into account
decimation, checking margins, and applying a density ramp
corrections, can be found in Techniques - 3d Reconstruction Using
Projection Matching <a href="./techs/recon/mr.html">Techniques - 3D
Reconstruction Using Projection Matching</a></p>

<p>The next step is to apply a screening procedure, which again can
be done interactively or in an automated way. Screening is
necessary since the decimated raw file does not allow a final
assessment of the quality. It is definitely needed if the particles
were picked automatically, since they were only selected by the
computer on account of their overall features (diameter).</p>

<p>Screening by hand is done by using the "categorize" option of <a
href="../../web/docs/web.html">Web</a>. This allows a gallery of
the selected particles to be displayed, and each particle to be
marked or categorized according to its quality. Most of the time,
"accept" and "reject" are the only categories used. According to
this classification, a flag is set in the output document file.</p>

<p>Another way of screening follows the method introduced by Lata
and coworkers (Ultramicroscopy 58 (1995) 381-391): particles are <a
href="./autopartpick.html">automatically classified</a> according
to texture descriptors. This is however not straightforward since
the parameters of the texture descriptors vary with the data. A
training procedure has to be followed first, in which, with the
help of a small particle subset and the "categorize option" in <a
href="../../web/docs/web.html">Web</a>, the user "trains" the
program in the use of the categories "noise", "good particle", and
"junk". On this basis, the texture descriptors are computed, which
are then used by the program to screen the data. This obviously
only makes sense if the data set to be screened is large.</p>

<h3>Local Fast Correlation</h3>

<p>Bimal Rath has developed a SPIDER procedure <a href=
"./techs/recon/newprogs/pickparticle.spi">pickparticle.bat</a> to
automatically pick particles from a micrograph (B.K. Rath and J.
Frank, Journal of Structural Biology, Volume 145, Issues 1-2,
January 2004, Pages 84-90). The procedure uses local
cross-correlation function calculated using Fourier methods
outlined by Alan Roseman (Ultramicroscopy, Vol 94, Issues 3-4,
(2003), 225-236). The local normalization optimizes the numerical
scaling of the search image and hence search results are very
accurate. Since most of the computations are done in Fourier space
the computation time is of the order of few minutes. Currently, the
procedure needs a 3D volume of the search image(as input) to
generate projections at desired Eulerian angles for searching
different orientations of the search image in the micrograph.
Different input parameters can be used, to apply desired
interpolation, to choose types of mask (symmetric or asymmetric),
to use SPIDER selection doc files (as Eulerian angles input) and to
use average of a number of projections as template image. The
procedure can be accessed by typing @@pickparticle at the SPIDER
prompt or inside any SPIDER procedure file. Two sets of input
parameters follow as examples. Note: For picking ribosomes from
micrographs one may use a zero degree projection, a symmetric mask
and an interpolation factor of 2. It works quite well.</p>

down to half and uses a symmetric mask.</p>
