<h2>Serial Section & Stereo Reconstruction Software Sites</h2>

<ul>
<p>

"Serial section reconstruction" software can refer to several different
methodologies.  
The following  listing is for software for "contour or structure" oriented
reconstructions.  That is, software which can align sections, then extract
(usually  manually) 3D structural information (such as contour outlines) from
the aligned images.  It tries <EM>not</EM> to list reconstruction software 
for volume rendering or simple stacking (alignment) of sections.  
Neither does it list software which merely segments an object from
a volume by thresholding or surface definition (such as the marching cubes
algorithm). "Contour or structure" oriented reconstructions are useful when
the data has gaps between sections or the desired information can not be
segmented algorithmically in a practical manner. </p>
