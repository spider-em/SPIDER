<h1 align="CENTER">47th Anniversary of SPIDER</h1>
<p /> &nbsp; <p />

<p>
 Although details have changed, parts of the current
 organization of the SPIDER system (in terms of procedure definitions,
 document files, registers, and symbolic parameters) go back to a
 number of brainstorms, some 47 years ago, with Brian Shimkin and
 Helen Dowse, both Computer Science students at SUNY Albany. The 
 <a href= "./spider78.pdf">first description of SPIDER</a> 
 was published in the  Proceedings of the International Conference on Electron Microscopy 
 in Toronto, in 1978.
