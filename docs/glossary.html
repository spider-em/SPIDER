<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="ACR"><b>Amplitude contrast ratio:</b> For a weak 
phase, weak amplitude object, the ratio <i>Qo</i> between the contrast 
transferred by cos(gamma) and sin(gamma) is called amplitude contrast 
ratio.  It is different for different atoms, and strictly speaking also 
different for different spatial frequencies.  Overlooking this dependency, 
the ratio is often given as a constant.  For a specimen composed of 
different atomic species, <i>Qo</i> can be empirically determined.  
It is in the 
range of 10% for cryo-EM specimens, and almost double for specimens 
negatively stained by heavy-metal salts.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Amplitude"><b>Amplitude correction:</b> correction of 
the 3D Fourier amplitudes of the EM density map after angular 
refinement.  This correction can be based on an analytical formula, 
namely by application of a temperature factor with negative B, or 
by reference to empirical measurements obtained by low-angle X-ray 
solution scattering (Gabashvili et al., 2000).
</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Angular"></a></p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><b>Angular reconstitution:</b> a common-lines method designed
to determine the relative angles between three projections of an
object with arbitrary symmetry [<a href="#vana">van Heel,
1987a</a>]. The method works on the basis of comparing sinograms,
which are plots of line projections as a function of angle.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Astigmatism"></a></p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><b>Astigmatism(axial):</b> an electron-optical lens aberration
that causes the defocus to be a function of azimuth, and the
contrast transfer function to deviate from circular symmetry about
the optical axis. As a consequence, the Thon rings deform into
elliptic or hyperbolic patterns, depending on the size of defocus
and the size of the astigmatic defocus difference. See 
<a href="astigmatism.html">astigmatism as defined by SPIDER
operations</a>.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Autocorrelation"><b>Autocorrelation function
(ACF):</b> the cross-correlation function of an image with itself.
The ACF is centrosymmetric, and its highest peak is always in the
origin, a shift position where both signal and noise contents of
the image overlap.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Back"><b>Back-projection:</b> a method of 3D
reconstruction from 2D projections. It is based on superposing 3D
functions ("back-projection bodies") obtained by translating the 2D
projections along the directions of projection. To obtain the
correct result, the projections must be weighted in Fourier space
prior to weighted back-projection.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Classification"><b>Classification:</b> separation of
an image set into subsets according to the similarity of features
[<a href="#Frank">Frank, 1990</a>]. Automated classification can be
done directly on the image set, based on [generalized] Euclidean
distances, or on a representation of the image set in a coordinate
system with reduced dimensionality, obtained by principal component
analysis or correspondence analysis. There are two often-used
classification methods: K-means and hierarchical ascendant
classification (HAC). In K-means, the data set is split into K (a
given number) subsets in such a way that each subset is maximally
compact, as measured by the intra-subset variance.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Coherence"><b>Coherence (spatial):</b> the degree to
which separate parts of the electron wave have defined phase
relationships, and are able to interfere with each other in the
image formation process. There exists a gradation from full
coherence (all parts of the wave have defined phase relationships)
over partial coherence (intermediate situation) to incoherence (no
defined phase relationships). In bright field electron microscopy,
the contrast transfer function is normally given for the fully
coherent situation, and the influence of partial coherence is
expressed by an envelope function.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Common"><b>Common lines method:</b> a method of
relating different projections of the same object to one another.
In Fourier space, 2D projections are represented by central planes,
which intersect each other along lines that go through the origin:
the common lines.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Contrast"><b>Contrast transfer function (CTF; also:
phase contrast transfer function):</b> function that describes the
transfer of information from the object (i.e., the object's
projection) to the contrast observed in the image for bright field
electron microscopy (the usual mode of imaging). If both object and
image contrast are expressed in terms of their Fourier transforms
O(<em>k</em>) and I(<em>k</em>), then I(<em>k</em>) =
CTF(<em>k</em>) * O(<em>k</em>). The two-dimensional variable k =
(kx , ky ) is called spatial frequency. In the absence of
astigmatism, the contrast transfer function is a function of the
radius <i>k</i> = sqrt(kx**2 + ky**2 ) only - transfer of
information is not direction-dependent.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Convolution"><b>Convolution product:</b> a 2D or 3D
function obtained as the result of a superposition integral. The
integrand is an image or volume, and the superposed kernel is a
typically short-range "point spread function" that expresses the
effect of a linear optical system in the formation of the image of
an "object." As the cross-correlation function, the convolution
product can be computed via FFT by taking advantage of a Fourier
theorem. Images should be padded prior to FFT computation of the
convolution, to avoid circular self-overlap.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Correspondence"><b>Correspondence analysis (CA):</b> a
multivariate statistical analysis technique, used to analyze
patterns of variation in an image data set. Together with principal
component analysis, CA belongs to the eigenvector methods of
ordination. In electron microscopy, the technique is used to (A)
reduce the dimensionality of the data set, so that automated
methods of classification are facilitated; or (B) obtain an
immediate inventory of the different components of variability
(e.g., depth of staining, rocking of a molecule, presence or
absence of a domain, conformational variability).<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Cross"><b>Cross-correlation function (CCF):</b> a 2D
or 3D function that is obtained by forming the scalar cross-product
of two images or volumes(i.e., the sum of products of equivalent
pixels) as a function of a 2D or 3D shift vector. The CCF is often
used to achieve alignment between two imagesor volumes, since it
displays a high value (a peak) at the place where a motif contained
in both images come into register. Note that for expediency, the
CCF is computed by taking advantage of a Fourier theorem. Because
of that, images or volumes should be padded prior to CCF
computation, to avoid circular self-overlap.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Defocus"><b>Defocus:</b> defocus setting (with
reference to the Gaussian focus) in the electron microscope,
normally given in Angstrom units, which determines the shape of the
CTF. For different settings of the defocus, different bands of the
object spectrum are emphasized. Note that in the electron optical
convention, overfocus means negative defocus values, underfocus
(the only useful range) means positive defocus values.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Defocusspread"><b>Defocus spread:</b> the spread of 
defocus due to the spread of electron energies or to the fluctuation 
of lens
current.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Differential"><b>Differential phase residual
(DPR):</b> a measure of statistical dependency between two
averages, computed over rings in Fourier space as a function of
ring radius (= spatial frequency, or resolution) [<a href=
"#Frankc">Frank et al., 1981</a>]. Typically, the DPR rises from a
low value (good average phase agreement) to a high value around 110
degrees (agreement between statistically unrelated images). A
cutoff value of 45 degrees is commonly used as resolution measure.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Drift"><b>Drift:</b> a movement of the specimen during the 
exposure time, which causes a blurring of the image.  It leaves a 
characteristic signature in the diffraction pattern, from which the type, 
the direction, and the extent of the movement can be inferred (Frank, 1969).</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Energy"><b>Electron energy:</b> the energy of an electron 
accelerated from its rest energy by a voltage <i>U</i>
is given by <i>eU</i>.  For example, electrons impinging on the specimen in an 
electron microscope operated at 100 kV have the energy 100 keV (kilo 
electron Volts).</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Eulerian"><b>Eulerian angles:</b> a <a href=
"euler.html">set of three angles</a> that define an orientation, or
direction, in space. It goes back to the mathematician Euler, and
was used to describe motions in celestial mechanics.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Fourier"><b>Fourier ring correlation (FRC):</b> a
measure of statistical dependency between two averages, computed by
comparison of rings in Fourier space [<a href="#Saxton">Saxton and
Baumeister, 1982</a>]. As the Differential Phase Residual, the FRC
is used to establish the reproducible resolution in single-particle
averaging. Typically, the curve falls off from a value of one
(perfect agreement) toward zero (no correlation). The point where
it falls below 0.5 is a realistic measure of resolution [<a href=
"#Boettcher">Bottcher et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#Penczek">Penczek,
1998</a> (=Appendix in <a href="#Malhotra">Malhotra et al.,
1998)</a>].</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Fourier1"><b>Fourier shell correlation (FSC):</b> same
as Fourier ring correlation, except that values of the discrete
Fourier transforms are compared within corresponding shells,
instead of rings [<a href="#vanb">van Heel, 1987b</a>.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Fourier2"><b>Fourier space:</b> the argument space of
the Fourier transform, spanned by the components of the spatial
frequency vector.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Fourier3"><b>Fourier transform (2D):</b> mathematical
representation of an image as a series of two-dimensional sine
waves. The smaller the wavelength, the higher the spatial
frequency, the higher the resolution of features in the image
represented. Each Fourier component is indexed by its spatial
frequency (kx, ky) and is given as a pair of numbers: amplidude
(describing the strength of the sine wave) and phase (describing
the position of the sine wave).<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="GEH"><b>Gaussian envelope halfwidth:</b> the halfwidth 
of the Gaussian in Fourier space, where the Gaussian is used to modify 
the envelope of the model CTF function. It is a composite parameter, 
used to account for a variety of effects, including drift, specimen 
charging effects, and multiple inelastic-elastic scattering. See 
<a href="./man/tf.html">TF</a>, Note #2.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="High"><b>High-pass filtration:</b> multiplication of
the Fourier transform of an image with a rotationally symmetric 2D
function ("the filter") that attenuates amplitudes at low spatial
frequencies k and increases amplitudes for high spatial
frequencies. This has the result of enhancing the edges in the
image while suppressing all slow-moving variations. Note that in
SPIDER, the <a href="./man/ff.html">FF</a> operation operates on the
Fourier transform, while the <a href="man/fq.html">FQ</a> ("Filter Quick") 
operation processes the image directly.        <br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Lambda"><b>Lambda:</b> [1] the electron wavelength. 
<i>Lambda</i> is calculated from the relativistic electron energy <i>kV</i>: <br />
Lambda = 12.398 / sqrt[kV * (1022 + kV)]

<br />
[2] in back projection, <i>Lambda</i> is a parameter used to 
control the speed of convergence. See <a href= "man/bprp.html">BP RP</a>, Note #3.
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Low"><b>Low-pass filtration:</b> multiplication of the
Fourier transform of an image with a 2D function ("the filter")
that attenuates amplitudes at high spatial frequencies k. This has
the result of blurring the image, and of eliminating sharp edges
and noise. Low-pass filtration is routinely used to limit the
information in a reconstruction to the reproducible resolution, as
found by resolution criteria (see Fourier Shell Correlation,
Differential Phase Residual). [See High-pass filtration, regarding
SPIDER operations <a href="./man/ff.html">FF</a> and 
<a href= "man/fq.html">FQ</a>].<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Padding"><b>Padding:</b> an operation that puts the
given image into a larger-sized array, surrounding it with pixels
equal to the mean value of the pixels within the image. Padding is
used to avoid self-overlap in the Fourier-based computation of the
ACF of an image, or the CCF of two images.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Pixelsize"><b>Pixel size:</b> the number of Angstroms 
per pixel in the digitized micrograph. Pixel size is computed as<br />
<pre>ps (A/p) = [10,000(A/u) * SR(u) * DF] / M</pre>
where ps = pixelsize, SR = scanning resolution, DF = decimation 
factor, M = magnification<br /> (units: A = Angstroms, p = pixels, 
u = microns). Thus, if the images were acquired at 50,000 
magnification, scanned at 7 microns, then reduced in size by 2, 
the pixel size would be (10000 * 7 * 2)/50000 or 2.8 Angstroms/pixel.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Point"><b>Point-spread function:</b> the kernel in the
superposition integral (convolution product) that expresses the
effect of a linear optical system in the formation of an image of
an object. Point spread function and transfer function form Fourier
pairs. In bright-field electron microscopy, the point-spread
function is the Fourier transform of the contrast transfer function.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Power"><b>Power spectrum:</b> intensity [= squared
amplitude] of the Fourier transform, presented either in the form
of an image (= the outcome of the PW operation) or as a profile (=
the outcome of averaging the 2D power spectrum azimuthally). [Note
that the SPIDER operation <a href="./man/pw.html">PW</a> furnishes
the amplitude, not the squared amplitude! This makes it easier to
use the distribution in displays and other operations, because of
the high dynamic range]. The complete length of the abscissa in
such a plot corresponds to the highest resolution represented in
the digitization: 1/(2 x sampling distance). For example, if the
scanning is done with 20 microns, and the electron optical
magnification was 50,000 x, then the highest resolution represented
in the digitized image is 5 x 10**4/(2 x 20 x 10**4) A**(-1) = 1/8
A**(-1). This means that the total length of the abscissa
corresponds to 1/8 A**(-1) in this case.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Random"><b>Random-conical reconstruction:</b> a method
of data collection and reconstruction used for single particles,
typically used initially in a project, to obtain a first
low-resolution reconstruction of the macromolecule [<a href=
"#Radermacher">Radermacher et al., 1987</a>]. Two images of the
same specimen field are collected, one with untilted grid, the
other with the grid tilted by 50 to 60 degrees. Any set of
particles presenting the same view in the untilted-specimen image
form a random-conical projection set in the associated
tilted-specimen image.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Refinement"><b>Refinement:</b> generally, an iterative
way of improving the accuracy, or resolution of a map by making use
of constraints, see three-dimensional projection matching.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Resolution"><b>Resolution:</b> the extent of
meaningful information in Fourier space, given by a spatial
frequency radius. In 2D averaging or 3D reconstruction of
macromolecules in single-particle form, the resolution is estimated
by splitting the dataset into halves, and comparing averages or 3D
maps from the independently processed halfsets by using a measure
of reproducibility. [See also <a href="#Fourier">Fourier ring
correlation</a>, <a href="#Fourier1">Fourier shell correlation</a>,
<a href="#Differential">Differential phase residual</a>.]<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Signal"><b>Signal-to-noise ratio:</b> ratio of signal
variance to noise variance, computed for a given band limit.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Sourcesize"><b>Source size:</b> the size of the virtual 
electron source in the electron microscope, resulting in illumination 
divergence, which determines the degree of spatial coherence.  The source 
size is given as an angle, in degrees or in terms of spatial frequency 
(i.e., mapped into the back focal plane).  For details, see Frank (1973).<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Spatial"><b>Spatial frequency:</b> (a) a vector giving
the frequency components (number of cycles per unit length, kx and
ky ) of a general 2D sine wave in x- and y-direction; or (b) the
length of a spatial frequency vector. In the 2D Fourier transform
plane, the spatial frequency vector gives the location of any
point. Points that have the same [absolute] spatial frequency lie
on a circle with radius sqrt(kx**2 + ky**2). For representation of
3D objects or images, the spatial frequency vector is
three-dimensional, with components (kx , ky , kz), corresponding to
3D sine waves, and points with the same [absolute] spatial
frequency lie on the surface of a sphere with radius sqrt(kx**2 +
ky**2 + kz**2).<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="SSNR"><b>Spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR):</b>
measure of resolution proposed by Michael Unser and coworkers
[Unser et al., 1987] [119-121].<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Spherical"><b>Spherical aberration (3rd order):</b>
electron optical lens aberration resulting in decreased focal
length for rays that are farther from the optical axis.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Thon"><b>Thon rings:</b> rings visible in the power
spectrum of micrographs obtained by bright-field electron
microscopy. These rings can be explained as the effect of the
contrast transfer function, which modulates the Fourier transform
of the object in a defocus-dependent way. Presence of axial
astigmatism is evident from deviations of the Thon rings from
perfect circular symmetry, defocus is gauged from the placement of
the rings, and resolution can be gauged from the range of the
rings. For these reasons, electron micrographs are routinely
inspected by optical diffraction, prior to scanning and digital
analysis.<br />
</a></li>
</ul>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Three"><b>Three-dimensional projection matching:</b> a
method of refinement in reconstructing single particles from their
projections [<a href="#Penczek">Penczek et al., 1994]</a>. A
preliminary 3D map, obtained by random-conical reconstruction or
angular reconstitution, is used to compute "predicted projections"
on a grid in angular space, which are held in the computer memory.
One by one, the experimental projections are now compared (by
cross-correlation, See CCF) with the set of predicted projections,
to find the best Eulerian angles representing their projection
direction. Next, a refined 3D map is computed, and again this is
used to compute "predicted projections," etc. For self-consistent,
homogeneous data sets, this procedure converges in a
higher-resolution 3D map.<br />
</a></li>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a name="Wiener"><b>Wiener filtration:</b> application of the
Wiener filter, designed to restore a signal in the presence of
noise in an optimal way, in the least-square sense.<br />
