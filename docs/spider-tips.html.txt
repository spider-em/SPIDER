SPIDER tutorial

Syntax, doc files and important notions


Magali COTTEVIEILLE -September 2009


Launch / terminate SPIDER

..SPIDER expects all files within a session to have the same filename 
extension. You specify it when you launch spider:

% spider spi/dat @script

..You can execute a series of tasks from commands stored in a file (cf. 
above), or interactively:

% spider dat.OPERATION: 
.

..Certain operations may have written data in the SPIDER results file: 
results.dat.0. A different results file will be created with each 
SPIDER run by incrementing the final digit(s) of the file name. 
..End your interactive SPIDER session/ your script:
EN / END (the results file is deleted )
..Comments in SPIDER scripts: preceded by a .;.


Doc files: write with SD

Information obtained during a SPIDER session can be saved to document 
files (called doc files). Data is written to a doc file with the SD operation, 
which writes one line at a time. The first number (here 1), is the key. This 
doc file can be read by other SPIDER operations; the key tells SPIDER 
which line to read/write.

.OPERATION: SD 1, [mic], [defocus], [max]
.DOCUMENT FILE: doc001

File Names

..SPIDER can substitute for any portion of the file name at run time 
using a value contained in a symbolic variable or register variable. 
Any text entered as part of a filename which is enclosed between "{" 
and "}" or "[]" brackets is presumed to be part of a desired 
substitution request.
..To substitute a register variable value into a file name, use the 
sequence {****[register_var]}where the "*" string denotes 
the number of digits for the substitution and the 
"[register_var]" denotes the register variable whose numerical 
value is to be substituted in place of the astericks.
..There may be any number of substitution strings within a single 
filename, e.g. the following is a valid filename: 
/usr/dir{*[dirnum]}/abcd{****[filenum]}


Image Stacks

..Multiple images can be stored within a single SPIDER "stack file.. A stacked 
image is referred to as: [ABC]@[###] where [ABC] is a sequence of 
alphanumeric characters and [###] is a sequence of digits. The digits after the '@' 
symbol represent the image number within a stack. Stacked images can be used 
anywhere a normal SPIDER file name would be used. 
An example of a filename that denotes image number 4056 inside stack file fil001 
is: fil001@4056.


Doc files: read with UD

; UD N counts the number of lines in the doc file, puts 
result in [n]
UD N[n] 
randoc

DO [idx] = 1,[n] ; Loop for each line in the doc file

UD[idx],[rotang]
randoc

RTfilt001rot{***[idx]} 
[rotang]
ENDDO

Inline files:

Ex:
RTtest001 
_1 ; ***** Replace the output filename with _160 

If the images are large, and there are many operations, you can 
clutter your disk drive with numerous unnecessary files. SPIDER 
allows special variables to be substituted for filenames. These are 
called inline files, and are denoted by _N, where N is a digit from 
1..99, preceded by one to three underscore symbols.


Variables


..Two types of variables are available in SPIDER. 
..Register (numerical) variables can contain any floating point value
..Symbolic (String) variables are strings of characters. 



..Both types of variables are denoted with '[]' brackets. 
..You should not simultaneously use the same variable name for both 
a symbolic variable and a register variable within a single procedure
..Variable names can contain alphanumeric characters plus '_' and '-.
..Variable names should start with a alphabetic letter not a digit
..Other special characters including a blank may work but are not 
supported and may cease to work in the future
..Names are case-sensitive.




Register (numerical) variables


..Register variables now have user specifednames. These variables are 
denoted with '[]' brackets 
..Old syntax, still valid: numerical register notations (e.g. X11)
..Ex: [size]=33 ; Create register variable




Symbolic (String) Variables


..Symbolic (String) Variables are denoted with '[]' brackets e.g. 
[filename]. 
..Syntax: example 1:
[filename] = 'PIC001'; Set a string variableThis is equivalent to the obsolete sequence:
FR L ; Set a string variable[filename]PIC001
..Example 2:
[filename] = 'PIC{***[filenum]}' ; Set a string variable
..Example 3:
GLOBAL [dir] = 'img' ; Set a global string variableGLOBAL [global_file]= '[dir]/IMG055'; Set a global 
string variable
..See in index of operation: operation VAR




Control Structures: DO Loops


..DO loops enable operations to be repeated. The DO loop syntax is:
DO <loop register> = <start_value>, <end_value> 
< Any SPIDER operations can be inside the DO loop >
ENDDO


..An older DO loop syntax that you may still see is is:
DO <Label> <loop register variable > = <start_value>, 
<end_value>
< Any SPIDER operations can be inside the DO loop >
<Label>




The IF Statement


..The IF operation is a control structure that provides conditional 
execution. The IF syntax is:
IF (TEST_CONDITION) THEN<any SPIDER operations>
ENDIF
..where the test condition tests the value of an expression (see 
example below). The SPIDER operations inside the IF statement 
are only executed if the condition is true, otherwise processing just 
moves to the next operation after the IF.
..Application: test the existence of a file; if it exists, do operations:
IQ FI [exists] ; If the following file exists, set [exists]=1, else [exists]=0randocIF ([exists].EQ.1) THEN 
DErandocENDIF




Most common error messages


..*** FILE NOT FOUND: test999.datCheck your inputs!!!
..Number of stars in the symbolic (string) variables don.t match the 
number of digits in the name of your images.
..You forgot ( ) to define values in loops
..Don.t forget to open your results file. If you have plenty, and you 
don.t remember which one is the last one: ls.lhtrres*




Procedure files


..Procedure files are subroutines that can be called from other 
procedure files. They can have variable arguments that change with 
every call to the procedure.
..If a procedure is called from interactive session, when a 'RE' 
operation is encountered inside a procedure, control will return to 
the terminal. If a procedure is called from another procedure file, 
control will be passed to the operation following the procedure call.
..See 
http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/quickstart.html#PROCSfor more




Register variable argument transfer to procedures


..To pass initial arguments from the procedure caller to the called procedure, the 
user puts the arguments (if any) needed by the procedure behind the procedure 
name, enclosed in parenthesis, in the same order as they appear in the called 
procedure file. Procedures may pass up to 12 register variable arguments if these 
are matched by a defining argument sequence in the procedure called. The 
defining argument sequence must appear as the first line of the called procedure, 
and must be of the form:
([<N1>],[<N2>],[<N3>],...)
Where: [<N1>],[<N2>],[<N3>],... are register variables appearing in the 
procedure. NOTE: Prior to 2004 '[]' brackets were used instead of '()'. The 
calling sequence must have the same number of registers, and must be of the 
form:
@<PROCNAME>>([<M1>],[<M2>],[<M3>],...). 
..Other possibility: operation RRExample: lfc_pick.spicalling pickparticle.spi:
; FIND IF A SELECTION DOC FILE USED.
RR X41? DO YOU WANT TO USE A SELECTION FILE (NO = 0, YES = 1) ?




Symbolic (string) variable transfer to procedures


There are 3 methods to pass symbolic variables to a called procedure.

..1)Replace the desired parameters inside the called procedure with a solicitation 
prompt and variable name for the parameters. Place the variable names behind the 
procedure calling statement in the exact same order as they will be queried in the 
called procedure. Inside the called procedure indicate that the variables should be 
obtained from the caller by placing a solicitation prompt enclosed in question marks 
followed by a symbolic variable name e.g., ?ROTATION ANGLE?[angle]in place 
of the variable that the user wishes to read.
..Example: if the procedure TEST_MASTER contains the following:
@TEST_VAR ; ProcedurePIC002 ; 1st solicited parameter (input filename)
30 ; 2nd solicited parameter (angle)
EN
..and procedure: TEST_VAR contains the following:
RT ; Rotate images operation?INPUT FILE? ; Solicit input filenameOUT007 ; Output filename?ROTATION ANGLE?[angle]; Solicit rotation angle and assign to symbol: [angle]
RE
..Then 
OPERATION: @TEST_MASTER will read the image PIC002, rotate it by 30 
degrees and store it in: OUT007.



Symbolic (string) variable transfer to procedures


There are 3 methods to pass symbolic variables to a called procedure.

..2) Use the FR operation inside the called procedure to create a local symbolic 
variable by reading its value from a calling procedure. Ex:
lfc_pick.spi calling pickparticle.spi:
FR 
?MICROGRAPH FILE (INPUT) NAME ?<1>

..3) Global variable assignment from the master procedure:
..Old syntax:
FR G -Read (sets) a global string (symbolic) variable:
Ex:
FR G[raw_file]img{***[iter]}
..New syntax:
GLOBAL [raw_file] = 'img{***[iter]}. ; Set a global string variable
