UNIX / Linux commands

Basic level

Magali COTTEVIEILLE - September 2009

What is Linux?

..Linux is a UNIX system
..Free
..Open source
..Developped in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
..There are several Linux distributions:
..Red Hat
..Fedora
..SuSE
..Mandrake
..Debian
..Ubuntu
...



What is Linux Shell ?

..Computers understand the language of 0's and 1's called binary. Shell accepts 
  your instructions or commands in English (mostly) and if it is a valid command, it 
  is passed to the kernel (part of the OS).
..Several shells available with Linux including:
..BASH ( Bourne-Again SHell) 
  Most common shell in Linux. It's a Freeware shell.
..CSH(C SHell)
  The C shell's syntax and usage are very similar tothe C programming language.
..KSH (KornSHell)
..TCSH. 
  TCSH is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell (CSH).



..Tip: To find your current shell type following command % echo $SHELL 
..Tip2:to know more about a command, don't forget the manual! Ex:
% man ls




Files and rights


..ls   ---lists your filesls-l---lists your files in 'long format', which contains lots of useful information, e.g. the exact size 
of the file, who owns the file and who has the right to look at it, and when it was last modified.
ls - a ---lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begin in a dot, which you do not always 
           want to see.
..There are many more options, for example to list files by size, by date, recursively etc.
ls.lhtr
..more filename ---shows the first part of a file, just as much as will fit on one screen. Just hit the 
space bar to see more or q to quit. 
..cat filename  ---displays the entire file
..emacs /kwrite/nedit/ filename ---editors that let you create and edit a file
..mv filename1 filename2 ---moves a file (i.e. gives it a different name, or moves it into a 
different directory (see below)
..cp filename1 filename2  ---copies a file
..rm filename   ---removes a file. It is wise to use the option rm-i, which will ask you for 
confirmation before actually deleting anything. You can make this your default by making an alias in 
your .cshrc file.
rm -r directory  ---removes a directory. You can use the option rm.rfto avoid confirmation 
questions
..chmod options filename ---lets you change the read, write, and execute permissions on 
   your files. The default is that only you can look at them and change them, but you may sometimes 
want to change these permissions. For example, chmodo+rfilename will make the file 
readable for everyone, and chmodo-r filename will make it unreadable for others again. Note that 
for someone to be able to actually look at the file the directories it is in need to be at least executable. 
See help protection for more details.

Rights owner group size date name

u g o (user, group, others)

To change the rights, 2 methods with chmod:

..chmod o+r myfile, chmod g-rw myfile, chmod u=rw,go= myfile
..chmod 777 myfile, chmod 555  myfile


Note: to change the rights on an entire directory:

chmod .R 777 mydirectory, chmod -R g+rw. 

To change the owner: chown

% chown magali bob myfile



Directories and paths

..mkdir dirname---make a new directory
...is your current directoy..is the upper level directory
..Paths can be absolute or relative:
../space/Yjjk/tmp/foo.txt is an absolute path.
..../tmp.foo.txt          is a relative path



..cd dirname   ---change directory. 
cd.. will get you one level up from your current positioncdwithout arguments will send you to your home directory, like cd~
cd ~/tmp = cd/home/magali/tmp
..pwd tells you where you currently are. 
..du filename ---shows the disk usage of the files and directories in filename 
(without argument the current directory is used). 
du -s gives only a total. 
du -h  --- human




Finding things


..find:
..find .name .refine-settings.pam.
..find .name .*.pam.
..find .name .vol0?.spi.



..grepstring filename(s) ---looks for the string in the files:
starbuck675% grepgrplooprefine.pam


; grploop<a href="./grploop.pam">grploop.pam</a> OR

; grploop/smangloopreturns [stop] 

@grploop([ang-step],[ang-limit],[radius],[alignsh],[prj-
radius],[iter],[grp],[stop],[maxspfreq])

..man: the manual pages to find the definition of a command/ 
options:
% man ps




Job control


..List your processes:
..top
..ps.ef: to see all the processes
..ps.ef| grepmagali: to see magali.sprocesses
..See man psfor more



..Kill a process: kill [options] PIDkill -9 32709
..Launch a job in background (to get the prompt back):
./spider spi/dat@apshgrp&
..If you forgot to lauchin background as you wanted:
./spider spi/dat@apshgrpPress Ctrl + Z (suspend job)
Then type bgto send it in background(Or fgto restore it in foreground)




Launch a executable


..The file you call must have the execution rights. If not, you.ll have an 
error message.
..Notion of default path:
..If you call spider, it will launch it although you don.t have a local copy. Why 
so?
..Either because it is defined by your PATH (environment variable):
% which eman/usr/local/EMAN/bin/eman
..Either because it is defined so by an alias:
% which spider 
spider: aliased to /usr/local/spider/bin/spider_linux_mpfftw_opt64 
..To know the content of you PATH:
% echo $PATH 



..From a local copy: example: you want to launch SPIDER in your 
current directory:
% ./spider spi/dat
..Generalization: the system must know the path of the file you want 
to execute.




Secure connections and transfers


..Connections:
..ssh:
ssh156.111.6.184ssh.X magali@156.111.6.184



..transfers:
..sftpmagali@156.111.6.184, thenput/get
..scp(-r) files machine:pathscp*.pam 156.111.6.184:/usr10/magali



..Example: connect and transfer files on the master node of the cluster
..Connect with ssh-X magali@156.111.6.1977
..Check the disk space:
/home/magali> df-h ./
FilesystemSize Used Avail Use% Mounted on/dev/sdc1 2.2T 1.3T 985G 56% /master.raid
..Check the space usage of your files:
magali/Master_cluster> du -hsctftilt262M ctftilt
..Transfer files from the cluster to your computer: 
scp.r Xlk156.111.6.46:/space
..Note: to log on a node from the master node:
% rshnode42
