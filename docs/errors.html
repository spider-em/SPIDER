SPIDER error messages may be due to: 

<ul>

<li>An operation error during a specific operation. An 
<a href="#operation_errors">operation error message</a> will be printed. If
SPIDER is being run 
<a href= "user_doc.html#interactive">interactively</a> the user may continue
with another operation. However if SPIDER is in 
<a href="user_doc.html#batch">procedure mode</a>, the program will
terminate immediately.                                </li>

<p />

<li>A system error during the language pre-processing phase, caused
typically due to incorrect syntax being detected by the command
interpreter. A <a href="#system_errors">system error message</a>
will be printed. Below is a brief explanation as to why such an
error may have occured. Such errors are always fatal!   </li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="debug">Debugging Procedure Runs</a></h2>

<p>For the debugging of procedure runs controlled by SPIDER procedure
files, it is important to know the mechanism of the procedure call.</p>

<p>Entering a SPIDER operation with the general format
@<i>filename</i> (where filename is 256 or fewer alphanumeric
characters; e.g. @<i>ROTAV</i>) will cause the system to look for a file
named <i>filename.projectcode</i> where projectcode is the project
code that is set upon starting SPIDER or set with the 
<a href="man/nc.html">NC</a> operation. If this file does not exist -- the
file <i>filename.sys</i> residing in the directory defined by the
system environmental variable SPPROC_DIR in the login file is used
for the procedure.</p>


If a procedure run stops unexpectedly, you should check the
RESULTS. file to see where exactly the error occurred and check
whether an error message is printed. Since file output is buffered,
the RESULTS file <em>may not</em> contain the actual final output.
The <a href="man/myfl.html">MY FL</a> operation will flush any
pending ouput to the RESULTS file. 

<p>Check the <a href="user_doc.html">User's guide</a> for a more
complete description of the SPIDER command syntax.</p>
