<h2>AP REF - Alignment - multi-reference, rotation &amp; shift ||*</h2>
<em>(01/05/121)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Compares a set of experimental images with a set of reference images.
For each experimental image, it finds the in-plane Euler rotation which
aligns the experimental image with the most-similar reference image. Then,
if translation search is specified, it finds the X &amp; Y shifts which align
the reference image with the rotated experimental image.
Can restrict angular range of projections. Can restrict checking of
a mirror image.
(See <a href="../align_overview.html">align_overview.html</a>
for comparison of 'AP' operations.)

AP REFD [spi],[theta][phi],[np],[exp],[cpsi],[x],[y],[nproj],[ang],[cc],...
<p>
.TEMPLATE FOR REFERENCE IMAGES: REF***<br />
[Give the template name of the existing file series of
reference images (typically projections).]
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: Selectref<br />
[Enter numbers of reference files. The file numbers can also
be read from a selection document file where file numbers
are contained in the first register (not the keys).]
<p>
.TRANSLATION SEARCH RANGE (ZERO FOR NONE): 5<br />
[For translational alignment enter limit on translational shift. A
response of '0' will give same alignment as obsolete 'AP MD', 'AP RD' or
'AP RN' operations.]
<p>
.FIRST, LAST RING, &amp; RING SKIP: 5, 30, 1<br />
[Only data at radii in the range 5-30 will be analyzed.
If skip=0 or 1, then every radial ring between 5 and 30 will be taken;
for skip=2, every second ring, etc.]
<p>
.OPTIONAL REFERENCE IMAGES ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: Refangles<br />
[Optional input file. Enter name of the doc file containing
<a href="../euler.html">Eulerian angles</a> (psi, theta, phi) for the reference images.
Enter '*' if you do not have any reference angles doc file.
<p>
.OPTIONAL REFERENCE-RINGS INPUT FILE: REF001<br />
[Give name of reference-rings file. If the file
exists, SPIDER will read the reference-rings data from this
file and will not read the actual reference image files. If
this file does not exist, SPIDER will create/store the
reference-rings data in incore memory. If
SPIDER is unable to allocate sufficient memory for the
reference-rings data then a reference-rings file will be created
and used during this alignment run. More than one
SPIDER run can use the same reference-rings file. <br>
Note that old responses 'W', 'Y', &amp; 'N' are now obsolete.
<p>
.TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE SERIES TO BE ALIGNED: data001@****<br />
[Give the template name of the existing file series of
experimental images. These images will be checked for
alignment versus the reference images.]
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-2100<br />
[Enter numbers of experimental image files. The file numbers can also
be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained
in the first register (not the keys).]
<p>
.OPTIONAL EXPERIMENTAL IMAGES ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT FILE: angles001<br />
[Optional input file. If '*' is given then this operation is
similar to obsolete 'AP MD'. If you desire to restrict the range of
angular search for projections then this doc file is necessary. It
must contain the current <a href="../euler.html">Eulerian angles</a> of experimental images
(projections): psi, theta, phi) and optionally the current
inplane rotation, shifts and other alignment parameters.
The output files from 'AP SH' and 'AP REF' contain such info.]
<p>
.RANGE OF PROJECTION ANGLE SEARCH &amp; ANGLE CHANGE THRESHOLD: 20.0, 5.0<br />
[Experimental images will be compared with only these
reference images whose normal is within the specified degree range.
If a '0.0' range
is input then there is NO restriction on which of the projections
are compared. The angle change threshold is an optional input which
is used solely to record how many angular projections differ by more
than the specified threshold from their previous orientation.]
<p>
.CHECK MIRRORED POSITIONS?, SHIFT AND ROTATE INPUT? (Y/N): Y,N<br />
[Optional check of the mirrored reference image. By using this check and
only providing reference images from one hemisphere of projection
directions, speed can be doubled (See Note: 1 below). <br />
The second answer is an optional request
to rotate and shift input images according to parameters in the
experimental images alignment doc. file before determining alignment.
(If this is 'Y' there is no need for 'dala' files.) For
backward compatibility the legacy '0/1' response is still accepted for
CHECK MIRRORED POSITIONS and second response defaults to 'N'.]
<p>
</dd> <dt>If register variables were specified on the operation line then
no output document file is created. Instead the registers
receive the output that normally would be put into the
document file. This is useful when only a single image is
being aligned. If you really want both register and document file output
you can over-ride this with operation: 'AP REFD'.
<p>
<dd>.OUTPUT ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT FILE: align_doc_01<br />
[Document file containing optimal alignment parameters for each
experimental image. Will append to an existing output file of
same name. This document file contains 15 register columns:

               angular range specified, these columns will contain 
               the experimental image's previous Eulerian angle

<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Reference projections of the existing structure
can be created using 'VO EA' and 'PJ 3Q' operations. 'VO EA'
creates an angular document file with quasi-evenly spaced
projection directions and 'PJ 3Q' creates projections
of the volume according to this doc. file.
<p>
<li>In 3D space the projection with the direction: (psi, theta, phi)
has its mirrored (around Y-axis) counterpart in the direction:
(-psi, 180+theta, phi) <br />
To save time, the operation can take this into account if you
speciify 'check mirrored positions'. In this case each experimental
projection is compared with the reference projection and its
mirrored version at the same time. Thus, only half of the total
number of reference projections are required; namely, only those
with 0 &lt; theta &lt; 90. <br />
If the best match was with the mirrored reference projection,
then the value stored in the 15th register of the document file
is negative and
the projection direction reported in the 1st register column is the
proper projection direction for the image. <br />
<p>
<li>The operation switches automatically between in-core and on-disk
versions depending on the memory available. The reference rings
file name is created/required in either case but it may not be
created if there is adequate incore memory is available.
<p>
<li>The operation is computationally intensive and parallelized for use
with either OpenMP or MPI.
<p>
<li>The alignment parameters from the output doc. file can be used as
input to further 'AP SH' or 'AP REF' runs during a refinement.
<p>
<li>Implemented by: Paul Penczek and ArDean Leith
<p>
<li>This operation never was written to provide comprehensive
sub-pixel resolution. Normally only about 50% of the shifts
are refined to provide sub-pixel estimates.
<p>
<li>Sequence of steps in alignment used inside this operation: <br />
Load gallery of reference images created by projection of
the reference volume. <br />
Load sample image. <br />
Perform a cross correlation in Fourier space on reference and
sample data. <br />
Find location of highest peak from cross correlation and
map it to a X &amp; Y shift for the sample image. <br />
Shift the sample image. <br />
Extract radial rings from a window of the reference image,
converting image to a polar representation. <br />
Take Fourier transform of the ring data and weight the data
corresponding to length and radius. <br />
Extract radial rings from shifted sample image, converting
image to a polar representation. <br />
Take Fourier transform of the ring data and weight the data
corresponding to length and radius. <br />
Perform a cross correlation in Fourier space on reference
and shifted sample data. <br />
Find location of highest peak from cross correlation and
map it to a rotation angle for the sample image. You now have
sample shift and rotation. <br />
Repeat with single pixel and some sub-pixel image shifts. <br />
Find location of highest peak from cross correlation and
map it to a rotation angle for the sample image. You now have
sample shift and rotation. <br />
Repeat for all sample images. <br />
