<h2>CL HC - Classification - Controlled</h2>
<em>(5/30/09)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>To find clusters of images/elements in factor space
(or a selected subspace) by using Diday's method of
moving centers, and to apply hierarchical ascendant
classification (HAC) using one of several methods
to the resulting cluster centers. <br />
Reads input from 'CA S' operation. <br />
Produces a Postscript dendrogram plot and a dendrogram
description doc. file. These
files can be used to determine the images/elements assigned
to each class (cluster).<br />
See: <a href="../techs/classification/tutorial.html">Classification and Clustering Tutorial</a>
for further info.

<p>
<dd>.OPERATION: CL HC<br />
<p>
<dd>.CORAN/PCA FILE (e.g. CORAN_01_IMC) : coran_IMC<br />
[Enter name of the
raw image data sequential file (_SEQ),
image factor coordinate file (_IMC), or
pixel factor coordinate file (_PIX) file
containing your data.
These files were created by
<a href="./cas.html">'CA S</a>.
(This operation is usually used with _IMC files).
<p>
.FACTOR NUMBERS: 1, 3, 4, 6<br />
[Enter the factors to be included in the hierarchical
clustering.]
<p>
.FACTOR WEIGHT: 1.5<br />
[Enter a weight for each factor selected. If the answer zero is
given at any point, all weights from the current factor onwards
are set to one. This question is asked as many times as the number
of factors specified, or is terminated by the answer zero.]
<p>
.FACTOR WEIGHT: 0<br />
[This question is asked as many times as the number
of remaining factors, or is terminated by the answer zero.]
<p>
.CLUSTERING CRITERION (1-5): 2<br />
[Enter the number indicating clustering criterion to be
used. Possible choices are: <br />
Option 1: &nbsp; Single linkage <br />
Option 2: &nbsp; Complete linkage <br />
Option 3: &nbsp; Average linkage <br />
Option 4: &nbsp; Centroid method <br />
Option 5: &nbsp; Ward's method]
<p>
.DENDROGRAM POSTSCRIPT OUTPUT FILE: HC_DEND_PLOT.ps<br />
[Enter name of file where the dendrogram will be stored.
Enter '*' to skip creating this file and skip the next question.]
<p>
</dd> <dt>If Postscript output was requested SPIDER asks.]
</dd> <dd><div class="opt_inp">
<br />.PLOT CUTOFF (0 ..100): 30<br />
[Enter the scale value value at which the dendrogram will
be cut/truncated. Only top portion will be produced.]
</div>
<p>
.DENDROGRAM DOC. FILE? (Y/N): HC_DEND<br />
[Enter name for document file where the UNTRUNCATED dendrogram
information will be stored. This file contains the class
numbers and height of all dendrogram branches. Using this
information, one can retrieve the images/elements which
are present in each of the classes. Enter '*' to skip creating this file.]

<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The RESULTS file contains the following information: <br /><br />
A) Aggregation history: <br />
For each of the NP partitions, the NS seeds and sizes of
clusters are listed. The non-empty clusters in the crossed
partition are given by size and cummulative percentage. A
total of NS**NP clusters are possible, but in practice, only
10% of these are non-empty. <br /><br />
B) Description of hierarchy nodes: <br />
The nodes are numbered starting from the number of the highest
cluster. For each node, the Senior, Junior, size, weight
and hierarchy index are given. The hierarchy index is printed
out as a histogram. <br /><br />
C) Description of the classes: <br />
For each node the constituent classes are listed. <br /><br />
D) Dendrogram: <br />
The class relationships are represented in the form of a
dendrogram (tree structure). The lengths of the branches (in
horizontal print direction) are proportional to the heirarchy
indices. <br /><br />
E) List of class members: <br />
The members are listed for each of the basic
non-empty classes. <br /><br />
F) List of class center coordinates: <br />
For each class, the NFAC coordinates of its center is listed.
These are contained in the cluster file. <br /><br />
G) Re-classification lookup table: <br />
Each cutoff point in the dendrogram, from right to left, defines
a new classification scheme with the number of classes increasing
by 1 each time. The table gives the new class memberships for
any cutoff point selected. <br /><br />
<p>
<li>To get the classification on a given "cutting" level use
operation: <a href="clhd.html">'CL HD'</a>.
<p>
<li>To get the selection doc files corresponding to the given
"cutting" use operation:
<a href="clhe.html">'CL HE'</a>.
<p>
<li>To calculate averages for the classes use operation
<a href="asdc.html">'AS DC'</a> and
selection doc. files.
<p>
<li>Every vertical line at the bottom of the dendrogram (with no cutoff)
represents an image that you input into 'CA S'. Each vertical line
is an average of the images, or vertical lines, below it. <br />
The threshold is a scaled value from 0 to 100 that informs 'CL HC'
how far "up" the dendrogram you wish it to look. A
threshold set at the bottom would result in the number of classes
being equal to the number of input images. A median threshold value
of 50 results in fewer classes. And a top level
threshold gives a single class containing of all the inputs.
<p>
<li>With untruncated results and/or very many classes the Postcript
plot lines/labels may be overwritten, sorry.
<p>
<li>Originally implemented by P. Penczek.
