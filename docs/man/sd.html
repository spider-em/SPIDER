<h2>SD - Save Document</h2>

<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Saves a set of register variables or a comment in a document file.
Up to 20 document files remain open until closed with 'SD E'.

SD //NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE <br />
<p>
.DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001<br />
[Enter the name of the file where the register contents
are to be placed.]
<p>
[There are four somewhat different methods of calling 'SD': <br />
SD &nbsp; [k],[r1],[r2],[r3] <br />
[Using this method the value of [k] is used as a key for storing
this register variable set ([r1],[r2],[r3]) in the file.
If the contents of the register variables are:
[k]=4, [r1]=30, [r2]=1.5, [r3]=270,
then the document file DOC001 will be appended with a text record
containing: <br />
&nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 30.0 &nbsp; 1.5 &nbsp; 270.0 <br />
where "4" is the key, "3" is the number of registers
following the key, and "30.0", " 1.5", and "270.0"
are the contents of the register variables [r1],[r2],[r3]
in the same sequence as they appear in the 'SD' operation.] <br />
<p>
SD &nbsp; [k],[r1],[r2],[r3] <br />
[Using this method when the value of [k] is negative (and greater than
-100000000) then the absolute value of [k] is used as a key and
this line of registers is placed in the document file
proceeded by a semicolon similar to a comment. This allows
the input and later retrieval of a limited set of values such
as rotation angles which are somehow associated with the
contents of the file. These lines will be treated like
comments upon retrieval unless you request the retrieval of
the appropriate negative key using 'UD'. This method is referred to
as storing a comment key in the doc. file. ]
<p>
SD &nbsp; /NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE <br />
[Using this method, a new comment is added to the document file
at the end of the previous contents. <br />
<p>
SD &nbsp; //NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE <br />
[Using this method, a new comment is added to the document file
at the end of the previous contents. The comment can contain
variables whose values will be substituted
(similar to the usage described in the 'VM' operation).
Final comment length limited to 160 char.] <br />

<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Any number of register values can be saved by one
operation. However, the total number of characters on the
operation line may not exceed 80.
<p>
<li>The key may be specified directly as a number, e.g. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; SD 15,[r1],[r2],[r3] <br />
No other registers may be specified in this manner. <br />
Example of an invalid operation: <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; SD 15,27.0,[r2],[r3] <br />
<p>
<li>The document file can be listed and edited with a text
editor as long as one or more blanks are retained between
each column of data. Each update via a run
of SPIDER is marked by the date and time of the SPIDER
session, as well as the project and data codes used.
<p>
<li>The key may also be the index of a DO-loop. However,
do not use 'X' as an index, as an error will result.
<p>
<li>Information on the actual names of the register variables is
lost in the document file.
<p>
<li>Up to 20 document files can be accessed concurrently. A
document file is closed with the 'SD E' operation.
<p>
<li>To decrease the amount of information printed in the
results file when using this operation use the 'MD' operation
with OPTION: 'VERBOSE OFF'.
<p>
<li>Alternating use of 'SD' and 'UD' for the same file may cause SPIDER
to get confused as to which document files are open. You will have to
use 'SD E' and 'UD E' to overcome this confusion.
<p>
<li>Following release: 19.08 the register variables are written with
13 characters, this should allow more exact specification for integers
up to a little beyond: 9,999,999.
