<h2>RB 32F - Rotate, Shift, Sampled, Back Projection in Fourier space |</h2>
<em>(1/10/07)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Changes the scale, rotates, and shifts image circularly.
Then calculates two randomly selected sample recontruction
and a total-3D reconstruction using interpolation in
Fourier space.Rotates counter-clockwise around the center
(NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1). (Negative angles = clockwise.)
This operation is the same as 'RT SQ' followed by 'BP 32F.
It is about 5%-10% faster than that operation sequence.

<dd>.TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE FILES (E.G. STK@****): INSTACK03@<br />
[Enter template for the names of the file(s) to be rotated.
This template can alternatively refer
to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or
to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@***), or
to a whole stack of images ending in '@' (e.g. stk@).
Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted
with a number for the file.]
<p>
</dd> <dt>If the template contains an asterisk the following question appears:
</dd> <dd><div class="opt_inp">
<br />.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-700 OR IMAGE_SEL<br />
[Enter projection file numbers or the name of the document file
containing projection file numbers in the first column.]
</div>
<p>
.ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGLES27<br />
[Enter the name of the document file containing Eulerian
angles for the projections used (psi, theta, phi) as well as
the in-plane rotation angle, X shift and Y shift. This data
must be in the same format as the output from the 'AP SH' or
'AP REF' operations.]
<p>
.SYMMETRIES DOC FILE: symmetries<br />
[Enter the name of the document file containing <a href="../euler.html">Eulerian angles</a>
defining symmetries (psi, theta, phi). The angles should be
such that when used in operation 'RT 3D' transform the volume
into itself. The identity operation (angles 0,0,0) MUST be included.<br />
The symmetries are enforced in two steps: projections related by the
symmetry operations are added in Fourier space to the volume; in order
to reduce the residual artifacts, additional real-space symmetrization
is applied. <br />
If there are no symmetries, enter symbol "*".]
<p>
.TRANSFORMED OUTPUT IMAGES TEMPLATE (E.G. ROT@****)',<br />
[Enter template for the names of the rotated and
shifted output image files.
This template can alternatively refer
to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or
to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@***), or
to a whole stack of images ending in '@' (e.g. stk@).
Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted
with a number for the file. However a single asterick will
skip any output for these images.]
<p>
</dd> <dt>If this output template contains an asterick SPIDER asks:
<p>
</dd> <dd><div class="opt_inp">
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: select_03<br />
[Enter the file numbers to be substituted into the output file name
template or name of a selection document file that contains
the file numbers in the first register.]
</div>
<p>
</dd> <dt>Next SPIDER will always ask the following questions:
<p>
<dd>.RECONSTRUCTED VOLUME: VOLUME001<br />
[Name for the backprojected output volume calculated using all
input projections specified in the selection document file.]
<p>
.FIRST SAMPLE VOLUME: VOLUME1001<br />
[Name for the backprojected output volume calculated from a randomly
selected set formed from half of the input projections.]
<p>
.SECOND SAMPLE VOLUME: VOLUME2001<br />
[Name for the backprojected output volume calculated from remaining
half of the input projections.]

<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>A change of scale will not change the image dimensions.
All the parameters agree with the output of the
marker program (operation
<a href="mk.html">'MK'</a>).
<p>
<li>The input file may be three-dimensional. In this case,
each of the slices is separately rotated and shifted with
respect to the Z-axis, and stored in the output file, which
will be created with the same dimensions.
<p>
<li>Shifts can be any real numbers.
<p>
<li>The accuracy of interpolation is much higher than that of the
bilinear interpolation used in the
<a href="rt.html">'RT'</a> operation, but it is
lower than the accuracy of bi-spline interpolation. In
particular, the derivatives of the interpolated image are
not continuous. The speed, however, is much higher than
bi-spline interpolation.
<p>
<li>Since quadratic interpolation is used, it is possible for
the output image min. &amp; max. intensities to be outside the
range of the input image.
<p>
<li>5x5x5 Kaiser-Bessel interpolation scheme is used.
<p>
<li>Sample volumes can be used to evaluate the resolution. The division of
projection data set is performed in a random manner. Therefore, the two
sample volumes will be different if the command is repeated on the same
data set.
<p>
<li>If you do not have enough memory in your computer to use
this operation substitute 'RB 3F' instead and invoke it
three times to create the various output volumes.
<p>
<li>This operation is NOT parallelized for use with MPI.
<p>
<li>Implemented by Paul Penczek and ArDean Leith.
<p>
<li>This operations was created because it was faster than
consecutive invocations of 'RT SQ' and 'BP 32F'. However
multi-processor / multi-core machines have taken away the
speed advantage. (al 2010)
