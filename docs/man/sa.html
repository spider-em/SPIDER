<h2>SA - Sum Alignment</h2>
<em>(8/01/01)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>To perform vector addition of rotation and shift values
from two successive cycles of alignment of an image
series. The summed values, saved in registers, can then
be applied to the original images. Additive interpolation
errors are thus avoided. <br>
This operation is meant for use with the angles and shifts
obtained from the 'OR' operations which have
to be used with reversed signs in 'RT SQ'.

<p>
<dd>.OPERATION: SA [xo],[yo],[zo]<br />
<p>
<dd>.INITIAL ROTATION ANGLE, X &amp; Y SHIFTS: [ang],[xs],[ys]<br />
[The rotation angle, the x-shift value, and the y-shift
value from the initial alignment cycle. These values
will typically have been retrieved
from a document file by an UNSAVE ('UD') operation just
prior to the call to 'SA'.
<p>
.REFINED ROTATION ANGLE, X &amp; Y SHIFTS: [angr],[xsr],[ysr]<br />
[The rotation angle, the x-shift value, and the y-shift
value from the refinement cycle. These three values
can also have been unsaved in the above manner from another
document file, or if the 'SA' is performed in the same
session (procedure run) as the second cycle, they may
simply be current register contents (see below).
<p>
The three registers specified on the operation line are
output registers, and receive the vector sums for the
rotation and shifts.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Rotational matrix used in 'SA' has form: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cos &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sin <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cos <br />
2 This operation is meant for use with the angles and shifts
obtained from the 'CC IC' and 'OR' operations which have
to be used with reversed signs in 'RT SQ'.
<p>
<li>'SA' may be applied most conveniently within the second
cycle loop. The intermediate image series (rotated and
translated by the amounts found in the first cycle) are
realigned against a refined reference, and the values are
stored in [angr],[xsr],[ysr]. The values from cycle 1 are then
UNSAVEd into [ang],[xs],[ys], and 'SA' is used to obtain
[xo],[yo],[zo].
These output values are finally applied to rotate and
shift the unaligned original image series. They should
also be saved in another document file, using 'SD'. Note
that two input and one output series must be on disk at
one time. The original images may be deleted individually
(within the DO-loop) once the corresponding final, aligned
images have been obtained.
<p>
<li>After having obtained the resulting angle and shifts the
'RT SQ' operation can be applied to rotate and shift
an image.
<p>
<li>In SPIDER 7.10+ input of numbers contained in registers is
no longer allowed. Registers are only for output now execept
when creating a document file.
