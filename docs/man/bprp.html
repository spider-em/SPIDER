<em>(04/12/12)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Calculates a sample reconstruction from selected projection
images using Richardsons constrained method.
Only works for square projection images.
See: <a href="../bp_overview.html">Comparison of 'BP' operations</a>.
&nbsp; <a href="../exa/bprp.html">Example</a>.

<dd>.OPERATION: BP RP [niter] <br /><br />
</dd> <dd>[Optional register variable receives the number of
iterations completed during the reconstruction.]
<p>
.TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE FILE: PROJ***<br />
[Enter template for projection image input files.]
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-700<br />
[Enter image file numbers or the name of a document
file which contains the image file numbers in its
first register column.]
<p>
.RADIUS OF RESTORED OBJECT: 23<br />
[Enter radius of reconstructed object in pixels (smaller than the
volume size). The reconstruction is calculated inside the
sphere only.]
<p>
.ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGLESDOC<br />
[Enter name of the document file which contains Eulerian
angles: psi, theta, and phi in the first three registers
columns. These angles specify the projection directions.]
<p>
.SYMMETRIES ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGSYMDOC<br />
[Enter <b>*</b> if the structure has no symmetries. <br />
Otherwise, enter the name of the document file containing
<a href="../euler.html">Eulerian angles</a> defining symmetries (psi, theta, phi). The
angles should be such that when used in operation 'RT 3D'
they transform the volume into itself. The identity
operation (angles 0,0,0) MUST be included. The symmetries
will be internally enforced on the volume. The
reconstruction in this case is calculated as though the
projections were multiplied as many times as there are
symmetries.]
<p>
.RECONSTRUCTED VOLUME FILE: VOLUME1001<br />
[Enter name for the output file.]
<p>
.LAMBDA, CORRECTION LIMIT: 1.0e-4, 0.0<br />
[<b>Lambda</b> determines the weight of corrections. Too small a
value results in long time of calculations; too large
value will terminate the iterations too soon. (Note #2). <br />
<b>Correction limit</b> can be used to terminate the iterations.
When the squared correction of the structure becomes
smaller than the preset value, the iterations are
terminated. When correction limit is set to zero,
it will not be used to terminate the program. Iteration limit will
be used instead.]
<p>
.ITERATION LIMIT, MODE: 25, 8<br />
[Program will terminate after number of iterations given. <br />
Mode determines the constraint(s) used: <br />
0 - No constraints. <br />
1 - Smoothing. <br />
2 - Min constraint. <br />
3 - Smoothing &amp; min constraints. <br />
4 - (No mode 4) <br />
5 - Max constraint. <br />
6 - Smoothing &amp; max constraints. <br />
7 - Min &amp; max constraint. <br />
8 - Smoothing, min, &amp; max constraints. <br />
Any combination of constraints can be used. The mode value
should be the sum of any single modes, for example mode=7
activates both min and max constraints, while mode=8 uses all three of
them. Constraints are ignored if mode=0, but dummy values should
still be entered on the next two lines.]
<p>
.MINIMUM, MAXIMUM: 1.77, 1.90<br />
[Values of min and max constraints: i.e., the max and min values of
the 2D projection data set. Constraints are ignored if mode=0,
but dummy values must still be entered.]
<p>
.SMOOTHING CONSTANT (0-0.999): 0.9994<br />
[Smoothing constant determines relative weight of the low-pass
filtration. See note #4. Constraints are ignored if mode=0,
but a dummy value must still be entered.]

<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>If the radius of the reconstructed circle is too large
comparing to the size of projections, a warning is printed.
The reconstruction is calculated, but it is incorrect
along the boundary.
<p>
<li>Lambda is used to control the speed of convergence. <br />
Too small value of lambda will result in a structure
that has high frequencies under-represented. The structure
will appear very smooth. Moreover, when such structures are
used to estimate the resolution (operation 'RF 3') the Fourier
Shell Correlation curve, after initial decrease, will increase
in high frequencies region. To remedy the problem, the
lambda has to be increased (Try: 10 times). <br />
An ever smaller value of lambda value of lambda will give Fourier
Shell Correlation curve that remains abnormally high for a long
distance . To remedy this problem, lambda has to be increased
(Try: 100-1000 times). <br />
Too large value of lambda will terminate iterations too
soon, earlier than requested number of iterations,
usually after the first two or three steps. This can be verified
in the output stored in the results file. The <b>resulting
structure will be incorrect.</b> To remedy this problem
lambda has to be decreased (Try: 2 times) and the operation
has to be repeated. If the problem persists, lambda
has be decreased again until the requested number of
iterations is performed.
<p>
<li>The smoothing constant determines relative weight of the
low-pass filtration.
It has to be larger than zero and smaller than one.
In addition the smoothing constant has to be lower than
1/(1+6*lambda).
Zero means no smoothing. <br />
To achieve stronger low-pass filtration effect one can
decrease lambda and increase the smoothing constant. <br />
Approximate frequency response:
<table cellpadding="4">
<tr> <th>Lambda</th><th>Smoothing constant </th><th>Res'n limit (pixels)</th></tr>
<tr> <td> .5E-3</td><td> 0.990</td><td> 3</td></tr>
<tr> <td> .5E-3</td><td> 0.997</td><td> 5</td></tr>
<tr> <td> .1E-3</td><td> 0.9994</td><td> 10</td></tr>

<p>
<li>It is assumed that projections are squares (NX=NY), so
the output volume will have dimensions NX x NX x NX.
<p>
<li>This operation parallelized for use with MPI.
