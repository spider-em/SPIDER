<h2>PJ ST - Projected Surface - Creation</h2>
<em>(04/22/97)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Create a surface image of a three-dimensional structure.
(I suggest you use the Web "Surface" operation instead ie
you want to make a shaded surface representation. It
uses similar algorithm, can usually rotate the volume,
is faster, and can save the output image.)

<p>
<dl><dt><strong>USAGE</strong></dt>
<p>
<dd>.OPERATION: PJ ST<br />
<p>
<dd>.3-D FILE: 3DR100<br />
[Enter the file containing the three-dimensional
structure.]
<p>
.ROTATION AXIS (Y) (=DEF) OR Z: Z<br />
[Enter rotation axis. Z as rotation axis is a lot faster
than Y.]
<p>
.OUTPUT FILE: SUR001<br />
[Enter the output file name for the surface image.]
<p>
.HORIZONTAL DIMENSION OF SURFACE DEPTH BUFFER: 100<br />
[Enter dimension in the X direction. Does not have to
be related to volume dimensions.]
<p>
.DEPTH FROM, TO: -32,20<br />
[Enter depth range which should be scanned. The center of
the three-dimensional structure is at zero depth, corresponding
to x-dim/2+1,y-dim/2+1,z-dim/2+1. Negative values are on the
near side of the surface, positive values on the far side, with
respect to the reference plane.]
<p>
.VIEWING ANGLE: 25<br />
[Enter angle, in degrees, between X direction of reference
plane and X direction of 3D object.]
<p>
.THRESHOLD: 0.25<br />
[Enter the threshold value that defines the surface. The
surface is defined by the values higher than a positive
threshold value or lower than a negative threshold value.]
<p>
.BACKGROUND (0)ZERO,(1)MIN,(2)MAX,(3)LOCAL MIN,(4)LOCAL MAX: 4<br />
[Enter the desired background for those areas in the resulting
image where no surface was found. Explanation of options: <BR>
<p>
0 = Set background to 0. (Option 0 must be used if subsequent
shading is to be applied to the surface. Other options will
result in a mottled background after shading.) <BR>
1 = Set background to the minimum (distance-1 of the surface
image). <BR>
2 = Set background to the maximum (distance+1 of the surface
image). <BR>
3 = Set background to minimum and correct for curvature in
Y direction. <BR>
4 = Set background to maximum and correct for curvature.
Options 3 and 4 can be used to reduce the dynamic range
of the depth buffer, when e.g. a long curved fiber
creates a large depth difference from one end of the
volume to the other and thus delicate surface features
are obscured. <BR>
<p>
To obtain the correct contrast, if no shading is being
applied, you must scale the final image with -1. Then option
'0', '1' or '3' will give a white background; option '2' or '4'
a black background.]
<p>
</dd> <dt>If a '3' or '4' was entered, SPIDER asks:
<p>
<dd>.BOX LENGTH FOR BACKGROUND FILTER: 25<br />
[Enter the box length, in the X direction, for box
convolution used in the background correction.]
<p>
.BACKGROUND OFFSET: 5<br />
[Enter offset of box-convoluted background. See
below for explanation.]
<p>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The background correction calculates the background
for each line in the surface image and does a box
convolution to low-pass filter this background
function. This function is then subtracted from the
surface image. The offset is necessary to ensure that
all parts of the surface are on the same side of the
background (if desired).
<p>
<li>For a detailed description, see: M. Radermacher &amp; J.
Frank (1984) "Representation of three-dimensionally
reconstructed objects in electron microscopy by surfaces of
equal density", Journal of Microscopy 136:77-85.
<p>
<li>When the reference plane is placed in the interior, then
a cutaway version of the object is computed. However, the
flat cutting plane of such a representation frequently
shows artifacts. In order to obtain a "clean" cutting plane
in the interior, you must create a separate volume from the
portion of the volume you wish to represent, and pad ('PD') the
new volume by adding at least one additional slice "in front".
If oblique representations are needed, then the number of slices
to be added in front must accommodate the extra depth.
<p>
<li>The 'PJ SHAD' operation would normally be used after this operation
to make a shaded surface representation.
