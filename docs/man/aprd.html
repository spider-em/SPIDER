<h2>AP RD - Alignment - multireference, restricted projections ||</h2>
<em>(1/28/04)</em><br />
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>
<dd>Compares a set of experimental images with a set of reference images.
For each experimental image it finds the in-plane Euler rotation angle which
aligns the image with the most similar reference image.
An experimental image is only compared with reference images
within a restricted angular range.. Mirrored positions are checked.
The only difference between this
operation and 'AP RN' is how they handle mirroring.
<br>(See <a href="../align_overview.html">align_overview.html</a>
for comparison of 'AP' operations.)
<br> <b> OBSOLETE! USE 'AP REF' INSTEAD!</b>

<p>
<dd>.OPERATION: AP RD<br />
<p>
<dd>.TEMPLATE FOR REFERENCE IMAGE SERIES: REF***<br />
[Give the template name of the existing file series of 2D
reference images (typically projections).]
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: SELECTREF<br />
[Enter numbers of reference files. The file numbers can also
be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained in the
first register (not the keys).]
<p>
.FIRST, LAST RING &amp; SKIP: 5,15,1<br />
[Only rings with radii in the range 5-15 will be analyzed.
If skip=0 or 1, then every ring between 5 and 15 will be taken;
for skip=2, every second ring; etc.]
<p>
.REFERENCE IMAGES ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: Refangles<br />
[Enter the name of the angular document file containing Eulerian
angles of reference images (projections): psi, theta, phi.]
<p>
.REFERENCE-RINGS FILE: REF001<br />
[Give name of reference-rings file. If the file
exists, SPIDER will read the reference-rings data from this
file and will not read the reference image file series. If
this file does not exist, SPIDER will create/store the
reference-rings data in incore memory. If
SPIDER is unable to allocate sufficient memory for the
reference-rings data then the reference-rings file must
exist. In that case, use operation 'AP I' to create
the reference-rings file. More than one
SPIDER run can use the same reference-rings file. <br>
Note that old responses 'W', 'Y', &amp; 'N' are now obsolete.
<p>
.TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE SERIES TO BE ALIGNED: DAT***<br />
[Give the template name of the existing file series of
experimental images. These images will be checked for
alignment versus the reference images.]
<p>
.FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME:1-21<br />
[Enter numbers of experimental files. The file numbers can also
be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained in the
first register (not the keys).]
<p>
.EXPERIMENTAL IMAGES ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: angles001<br />
[Enter the name of the angular document file containing Eulerian
angles of experimental images (projections: psi, theta, phi.
Experimental images will be compared with only these
reference images whose normal is within a specified range from
this angular value.]
<p>
.RANGE OF ANGULAR SEARCH: 20.0<br />
[Experimental images will be compared with only these
reference images whose normal is within 20 degrees range.]
<p>
.OUTPUT ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: APMD101<br />
[This is the only output produced by this program.
It contains 7 register columns: <br>
<p>
1.Number of the most similar reference image.<br>
When this number is negative, the most similar is the
mirrored projection (see note 1).
When no matching projection was found within
the angular range specified, this column will contain 0.<br>
<p>
2.Not-normalized correlation coefficient. <br>
Can be used as a similarity measure. <br>
<p>
3. "-psi" angle. <br>
In-plane rotation angle determined. To use in 3D
reconstruction programs invert the sign.
<p>
4. Always 0.0 <br>
<p>
5. Always 0.0 <br>
<p>
6. Experimental projection number. <br>
<p>
7. Angular change for projection.] <br>

<p>
<strong>NOTES</strong>
<ol>
<p>
<li>In 3D space the projection with the direction: (psi, theta, phi)
has its mirrored (around X-axis) counterpart in the direction:<br>
(-psi, 180-theta, phi+180).<br>
To save time, the program takes this into account, and each data
projection is compared with the reference projection and its
mirrored version at the same time. Thus, only half of the total
number of reference projections are required; namely, only those
with 0&lt;theta&lt;90.
If the best match was with the mirrored reference projection,
then the number stored in the first column of the document file
is negative (see included batch program).
<p>
<li>The reference projections (of the existing structure)
can be created using 'VO EA' and 'PJ 3Q' commands. 'VO EA'
creates an angular document file with quasi-evenly spaced
projection directions and 'PJ 3Q' creates projections
of the volume according to this doc file.
<p>
<li>The output document file created by 'AP MD' can be converted
to the angular document file using 'VO MD' command. Please
note that in this case the angular document file created
by VO EA is required.
<p>
<li>The operation switches automatically between in-core and on-disk
versions depending on the memory available. The reference
rings file can be used in either case.
<p>
<li>Columns number 4 and 5 in the output document files
are always filled with zeros and
correspond to zero translation. This is done to keep the
the document file format the same as in AP MD command.
<p>
<li>The operation is computationally intensive. The code is
parallel.
<p>
<li>An example of the SPIDER batch program which can be used to produce
an angular document file from the output document file of this
command is included in the manual chapter for the command 'VO MD'.
