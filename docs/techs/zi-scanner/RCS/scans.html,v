<center><h3>Comparison of HiScan & ZI scanners</h3></center>
The same micrograph was scanned in both the HiScan and ZI scanners.<br>
Overview #2 was extracted from the ZI scan for comparison.

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th> </th><th>HiScan file</th><th>ZI file, overview #2</th></tr>
<tr><td>size (pixels)</td><td align="CENTER">5336 x 6836</td><td align="center">5546 x 7145</td></tr>
<tr><td>pixel size (A)</td><td align="center"> 2.93</td>
<td align="center">2.82</td></tr>
</table>

Note that the zeroes (minima) in the ZI scan are better defined 
and are discernible at higher resolution. (Scales are slightly 
different due to the different pixel sizes.)
