<a name="clcla">

<h4> Automatic Clustering and Hierarchical Classification - Using 
    <a href="../../man/clcla.html">'CL CLA'</a> </h4>

<p>With the "useful" eigenvectors known, we can more efficiently 
   determine the representative clusters. 
   <a href="../../man/clcla.html">'CL CLA'</a> only uses
   Diday's method for clustering, and Ward's criterion for 
   Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) so the user does
   not select the clustering criterion. Also the user can
   not specify the factor weights.</p>

<p>The procedure: <a href="clcla.spi">clcla.spi</a> invokes  
   <a href="../../man/clcla.html">'CL CLA'</a> 
   which reads the <i>CA/PCA</i> files from 'CA S' and creates
   a dendrogram document file and a 
   <a href="save/clcla_dend.jpg">dendrogram plot</a> file.
</p>

Hints for using: <a href="../../man/clcla.html">'CL CLA'</a> 

<ul>
   <li>"CORAN/PCA FILE PREFIX" is the response previously given for the 
       "Output file prefix" question in 'CA S'. </li>

   <li>"CLUSTER OUTPUT FILE FOR 'CA SM' USE" is a file to use with 
       <a href="../../man/casm.html">'CA SM'</a> to name 
       cluster points by image.  Not otherwise used in  
       <a href="https://spider-em.github.io/Web/docs/web.html">Web</a> or SPIDER.</li>

   <li>'CL CLA' uses the "moving center" method. Iterations are how 
       many times the center is moved, and the centers per partition
       is how many  points are initially used, per partition. </li>

   <li>"NUMBER OF INITIAL CLUSTERS" signifies the number of clusters 
        'CL CLA' will initally expect.</li>

   <li>"OCCUPANCY LEVEL FOR CLASS CUTTOFF" is the level or elements/images 
        at which a class is not included in dendogram. </li>

   <li>The "DENDROGRAM POSTSCRIPT OUTPUT FILE" plot is useful to show the 
       relationship between clusters/classes.  </li>

   <li>The "PLOT CUTTOFF" can be used to truncate the lower edge of the
       dendrogram to remove excess branches. </li>
       The many small differences at the bottom can be eliminated 
       with an increase of the "% cutoff" setting. </li>
 
   <li>A The output "DENDROGRAM DOC FILE" can be used with 
         <a href="https://spider-em.github.io/Web/docs/web.html">Web</a> 
         to produce dendrograms with cluster averages. It is also used with the
         <a href="../../man/clhd.html">'CL HD'</a> and 
         <a href="../../man/clhe.html">'CL HE'</a> 
         operations to create document files listing
         the images assigned to each cluster.</li>

   <li> The SPIDER <a href="save/clcla_results.dat">results</a> file  
        holds a large amount of useful information after a 
        <a href="../../man/clcla.html">'CL CLA'</a> run.</li>

<!-  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Classification Using K-Means.... xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ->

<hr />
<a name="clkm">

<h4> Automatic K-Means Clustering and Classification - Using  
     <a href="../../man/clkm.html">'CL KM'</a> </h4>

<p>K-Means is a method of classification that divides the data into a 
   user specifed number of clusters. Two random images "seeds" are chosen, 
   and their centers of gravity are computed. A partition is drawn down 
   the middle between the centers, the new centers of gravity are computed, 
   and the process is repeated for a given number of times. The final result 
   is VERY dependent on which image seeds are the first chosen.
</p>

<p>Because our faces data set is synthetic, we know the exact 
   number of classes and exactly which images are identical 
   (except for the random noise). The output discussed here was obtained 
   with 8 classes, using factors 1-3, and an uniform factor weight of 1.0 
   for all three factors. (NOTE: The pictures were from a data set with somewhat
   different noise from other runs discussed in this tutorial.)
</p>

<p>The procedure: <a href="clkm.spi">clkm.spi</a>  invokes
   <a href="../../man/clkm.html">'CL KM'</a> 
   and creates class averages for the specified number of classes.
</p>

Hints for using: <a href="../../man/clkm.html">'CL KM'</a> 
<ul>
   <li>"CORAN/PCA FILE" must be the FULL name of the file you want 
        to use (without the data extension), this is because it can input 
        <i>SEQ, PIX, or IMC files</i>.                                 </li>
   <li>"NUMBER OF CLASSES" = # different clusters.                     </li>
   <li>"RANDOM SEED STARTING NUMBER", this should be made note of, so you can  
        re-create runs from the same data using the same random number.</li>
   <li>"TEMPLATE FILENAME", for each class/cluster requested, 'CL KM' outputs a file 
       with this prefix.                                               </li>
   <li>DOCUMENT FILE, this operation creates a single output file that lists the class 
       assigned for each image/pixel.                                  </li>
</ul>

<p>The doc file: <a href="save/clkm_453_doc.dat">clkm_453_doc</a> 
   was produced by a run of 
   <a href="../../man/clkm.html">'CL KM'</a> 
   with the above input values with a random number seed of 453.
 
   The third column describes the image number and the 
   fourth column is the class that 'CL KM' placed the image in. Images 1-10 
   were all placed in cluster 6, which is what we expect because they are 
   all noisy images of the same protoimage. 'CL KM' kept the images from 
   the same protoimage clustered together somewhat, except for the last 
   ten images. However, it preferred to place images 11-20 and 31-40 
   in the same cluster, instead of each giving them each their own cluster. 
   The average image for images 11-20 and 31-40 are shown below. They 
   differ by their mouth size. </p>

                  <img width="64" height="64" src="save/sca040.jpg">
</p>

<p>The doc file: <a href="save/clkm_789_doc.dat">clkm_789_doc</a> 
   was produced by a run of <a href="../../man/clkm.html">'CL KM'</a>
   exactly same as the previous run, except with a random number seed of 789. 

   Once again, most images were placed into 
   the correct protoimage cluster correctly, except for the last few images. 
   But in addition to images 11-20 and 31-40 being clustered together, 
   images 1-10 and 21-30 were placed in the same cluster as well. This 
   clearly demonstrates that K-means is highly dependent on the first 
   image chosen, and should be used with extreme caution. Below are 
   the average images for 1-10 and 21-30.

</p>

<p>The doc files: <a href="save/clkm_SEQ_453_doc.dat">clkm_SEQ_453_doc</a> and 
                  <a href="save/clkm_PIX_453_doc.dat">clkm_PIX_453_doc</a> 
   are outputs from 'CL KM' being run on the same data as above, but using 
   the <i>SEQ </i> and  <i>PIX</i> files, respectively. 
   The clkm_PIX_453_doc.dat file is 95Kb in size. 
   The results for the  <i>SEQ</i> run should be the same result as the 
   previous runs, because it is still comparing images. However, the <i>PIX</i> 
   results are expected to be different because it is trying to place 
   the PIXELS in eight different classes.
