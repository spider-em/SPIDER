<dt><strong>QUESTION</strong></dt>

<dd>What is single-particle reconstruction?<br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><strong>ANSWER</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Biological macromolecules are highly susceptable to radiation
damage when exposed to the electron beam. Therefore, imaging
macromolecules using the electron microscope entails some kind of
averaging over molecule images that have been obtained with an
extremely low dose (<i>low-dose imaging</i>). For such an average
to be meaningful, the molecules must be in precisely the same
conformation and binding state.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Traditionally, to obtain multiple images of an entire ensemble
of molecules, one would use a <a href="img/particles1.jpg">crystal</a>. 
In a crystal, all molecules are in
the same conformation and binding state (as a result of high
purification that is normally a prerequisite to crystallization,
and of the highly homogeneous microenvironment of each molecule).
They are also, convenient for averaging, in the same orientation
and ordered position. X-ray crystallography makes use of the high
order, since the ordered arrangement enables the collection of
diffraction patterns. In electron microscopy, the strong
interaction of electrons with matter implies that the crystal
should be no thicker than a single layer (<i>two-dimensional
crystal</i>}.</p>

<p>Advantages of using two-D crystals:</p>

<ul>
<li>high homogeneity</li>

<li>well-developed theory of reconstruction</li>

<li>atomic resolution demonstrated for a dozen of molecules</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
 

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>only a single conformation or binding state, out of several
potentially important ones, is realized as a result of th e crystal
constraints;</li>

<li>computation becomes difficult in the presence of disorder;</li>

<li>slow progress of many projects because of the difficulty of
growing crystals that are sufficiently well ordered.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
 

<p><a href="img/particles2.jpg">Single-particle reconstruction</a> is
the term used for the reconstruction of a macromolecule from images
of a specimen in which the molecule exists in many realizations in
the form of single, isolated particles, i.e., without contact with
neighboring molecules. Thus, without the need for crystallization,
there is in principle no restriction on the kinds of macromolecules
that can be reconstructed.</p>

<p>Advantages of using single-particle reconstruction:</p>

<ul>
<li>all solution states can be captured in principle;</li>

<li>disorder is no longer an issue, since each molecule is treated
separately;</li>

<li>no need for crystallization.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
 Disadvantages: 

<ul>
<li>coexistence of several conformational states poses
difficulties;</li>

<li>theory, especially related to the separation of different
states, is far from complete;</li>

<li>large computational expense.</li>
</ul>
