<h3 align="CENTER">Strategies for 3D reconstruction of
macromolecules existing as single particles</h3>

<p>The aim of the "single-particle" image processing with SPIDER is
to obtain a 3D reconstruction of a macromolecule from a large set
of particle images (that are obtained with the electron
microscope), based on the premise that each of these particle
images shows the same structure. Since the macromolecule is single,
without a structural context that would stabilize its orientation,
it occurs in many different orientations. Thus, the electron
micrograph normally displays a wide range of particle views. But it
is unknown, in the absence of prior knowledge, how these views are
related to one another. Thus the 3D reconstruction procedure must
deal with two separate issues:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>How to find the relative orientations (each given in terms of 3
<a href="./glossary.html#Eulerian">Eulerian angles</a> and two <a
href="./glossary.html#Translational">translational parameters</a> )
of the particle projections;</li>

<li>Provided these orientations are known, how to reconstruct the
macromolecule from the projections.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a guide on how to proceed, using established
methods of orientation search and 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p>Let's say the structure is entirely unknown. In that case, you
have to start from scratch:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Orientation determination using the 
<a href= "./glossary.html#Random">random-conical</a> 
data collection method.
This method uses a defined geometry in the data collection, and is
able to find the handedness of the structure unambiguously. Each
specimen field is imaged twice, once tilted, once untilted.
Particles are selected simultaneously from both untilted- and
tilted-specimen fields, using a special interactive
particle-selection program that is able to "predict" the location
of a particle in the tilted-specimen field when its counterpart has
been selected in the untilted field. This program is part of WEB.
From the untilted-specimen particle data set, all particles are
selected that exhibit the same view. This can be done by using 
<a href="./glossary.html#Alignment">alignment</a> 
followed by 
<a href= "./glossary.html#Classification">classification</a>. The
corresponding tilted-specimen data subset can be used to compute a
reconstruction: the orientations of the tilted-particle projections
lie on a cone with fixed angle (the tilt angle) and random azimuths
(the in-plane angles found in the alignment of the untilted
particle set).</li>
</ul>

-- or - 

<ul>
<li>Orientation determination using 
<a href= "./glossary.html#Common">common lines</a> (a.k.a. 
" <a href= ./glossary.html#Angular">angular reconstitution</a> "). 
This method is based on the fact that in 
<a href= "./glossary.html#Fourier2">Fourier space</a> 
any two projections
intersect along a central line ("the common line"). Hence, in
principle, the relative orientations between three projections can
be determined - except that the handedness of the constellation is
ambiguous. Because of the low 
<a href= "./glossary.html#Signal">signal-to-noise ratio</a> 
of raw particle
images, averages of projections falling into roughly the same
orientation must be used. In the SPIDER implementation (operation
<a href="man/op.html">OP</a>),  
any number of views can be used in a simultaneous optimization
scheme. Since the procedure leads to solutions presenting local
minima, it must be repeated several times to find solutions that
form a cluster, presumably around the global minimum. Such
clustering of solutions can be detected by 
<a href="./glossary.html#Multivariate">multivariate statistical
analysis</a> of the resulting 3D maps. Two clusters are expected,
one for each 
<a href="./glossary.html#Enantiomorph">enantiomorph</a>. 
After an initial
structure is obtained, it should be further refined using 
<a href="./glossary.html#3D">3D projection matching</a> 
strategy described next.</li>
</ul>

However if the structure is already available from a previous
reconstruction, albeit at low resolution, you can use the existing
template in the following way: 

<ul>

<li>Orientation determination by 3D projection matching. Here the
existing 3D map is projected from many orientations on a regular
angular grid, and the resulting projections that are kept in 
computer memory are compared, one by one, with each of the
experimental projections. This comparison (by 
<a href="./glossary.html#Cross">cross-correlation</a> ) 
yields a refined
set of <a href="./glossary.html#Eulerian">Eulerian angles</a> ,
with which a refined reconstruction can be computed using one of
the reconstruction techniques listed below. This procedure then
goes on in several cycles, until the angles for each projection
stabilize. 

<p>When you have a set of projections whose orientations are known,
you can use either one of the following two reconstruction
techniques. Note that the second of these is much slower but gives
better results:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./glossary.html#Weighted">Weighted back-projection</a>
using general weighting functions 
( <a href="./man/bp3d.html">BP 3D</a> ). 
The back-projection operation is the reverse of the
projection operation: each projection image is translated in the
direction of the projection, to yield a "back-projection body." All
these back-projection bodies are superimposed and summed in their
correct orientations, yielding an approximation to the
reconstruction. <a href="./glossary.html#Filtration">Filtration</a>
by a weighting function is necessary since the transition from the
polar to the Cartesian coordinate system leads to an imbalance in
the representation of spatial frequencies. This weighting is very
simple in the case of equal angular increments, but becomes very
complicated (General weighting) when an arbitrary distribution of
angles must be accommodated, as in our case. Since general
weighting entails some approximation, and since weighted "BP 3D"
methods do not allow the use of constraints, the results are not as
good as with <a href="./glossary.html#SIRT">SIRT</a>, described
below. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) 
( <a href="./man/bprp.html">BP RP</a>  and  
  <a href="./man/bpcg.html">BP CG</a> ). 
The 3D reconstruction algorithm
called Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) seeks
to minimize the discrepancy between the 2D projection data and 2D
projections of the structure. The reconstruction process begins
with setting to zero the elements of the initial volume and
proceeds iteratively by using the 2D error between projection data
and projected current approximation of the structure as current
corrections. Although the results of this algorithm are of very
high quality, its rate of convergence is slow and the
recommended number of iterations is 100. In addition, the 
<a href= "./man/bprp.html">BP RP</a> 
implementation of SIRT has a provision
for reconstruction of symmetric structures. The list of symmetries
has to be provided in a form of angular document file. The Eulerian
angles have to be given in the order (psi, theta, phi) and the null
transformation (psi,theta,phi)=(0,0,0) has to included on the
list.</li>
