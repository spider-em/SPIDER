<h1 align="center">MRC Support in <i>SPIDER</i></h1>

<hr />

<h3 >Support for MRC data files in <i>SPIDER</i>. </h3>

<p> In 2019 many authors, who cite the use of SPIDER in their research,  
    utilize it for general image processing of electron microscopy data and 
    for the development of new algorithms rather than routine 3D 
    reconstruction. Since they regularly use other softwares which usually
    have data in MRC format it would be usefull if SPIDER could directly
    accept such data. 
</p>

<p> <i>SPIDER</i> <b>can now load and create MRC format </b> image and volume
    files.  Just specify the  full file name including the extension
    e.g. <i>file.mrc</i> or <i>'file.mrcs'</i>  anywhere that
    <i>SPIDER</i> requests a filename. For MRC stacked images/volumes you can
    use:   <i>1@file.mrc</i>. For prompts that request a stack template use:
    <i>*@file.mrc</i>. <a href="../docs/exa/images/exa-mrc.spi">Examples</a>.  
</p>   

<p> Currently any newly created MRC file from
    SPIDER, <small>unless you have altered the defaults with
    <a href="man/mdmrc.html">'MD MRC'</a> </small>, 
    will contain 32 bit floating point data and the 
    first data point inside the file will be the upper left corner 
    of the image and the bottem of a volume (UL L) which is the
    same as in SPIDER data files. 
</p>


<p> A few operations, especially on MRC stacks, may fail due to the lack
    of required header information such as the current file data range
    (min and max) or statistics (mean, std.) I suggest you use MRC
    format only when you wish to pass files to/from other software and
    continue to use SPIDER format within procedures, etc. due to many
    <a href="./random.html#mrc_stacks">deficiencies in the MRC file format</a>.
</p>

<p> The most glaring of these deficiencies is that there
    is <b>NO</b> agreement for how the actual image/volume data is ordered
    within the file. As pointed out by the 
    <a href="http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/mrc_format/mrc2014.php">
    <i> Collaborative Computational Project for Electron Cryo-microscopy (CCP-EM)
    </i></a>: 
</p>

<blockquote> <p> The handedness of the data block is not well
defined by the MRC2014 standard. Conventionally, many pieces of software
have treated the data as right-handed, with the origin in the bottom
left corner of a 2D image and the Z-axis pointing out of the screen.</p>

<p> However, this approach is not universal, and some packages treat the
    data block as left-handed. An example is FEI's EPU data acquisition
    software, which places the image origin in the top left, as
    documented in appendix C of the EPU User Manual.               </p>

<p> Proposals for indicating the data handedness in the file header are
under discussion, but for now, the only way to be sure of the handedness
is to check the behaviour of each software package individually.   </p>
</blockquote> 
</p>

<p>  It appears RELION, ImageJ (Fiji), and now SPIDER expect that the
     origin and  the first pixel in the data storage is at the upper
     left of the image. This  ordering is more efficient for loading an
     image since file access is efficiently buffered.  But IMOD and
     Chimera expect the origin and the first pixel to be at the  lower
     left of the image. 
</p>


<p> Use of <i>SPIDER</i> with MRC/MRCS images for/from <i>RELION</i>
    and <i>CryoSPARC</i> is straight forward with regard to
    origin/handedness as these softwares expect the same
    'UL L' image origin and handedness as <i>SPIDER</i>. <br />
 
    Use of <i>SPIDER</i> with 'LL L' images for/from <i>IMOD</i> and 
    <i>ImageJ</i> is somewhat non-intuitive. <i>SPIDER</i> loads these
    images as mirrored so that it can address pixel locations properly.
    <i>SPIDER</i> has operations: 
    <a href="man/cpfrommrc.html">'CP FROM MRC'</a>, 
    <a href="man/mrche.html">'MRC HED'</a>, 
    <a href="man/st.html">'ST' with option '(D)ATA-ORIGIN'</a>, and 
    <a href="man/mdmrc.html">'MDMRC'</a> with option '(D)ATA-ORIGIN', 
    which are useful in trying to process such images.       </p> 

<p> A posssible problem with use of <i>SPIDER</i> with MRC/MRCS images 
    for/from <i>RELION</i> and <i>CryoSPARC</i> is differences in recognizing
    and processing the images without current density statistics,
    especially in stacks. The 2014 format standard proposed the 
    following convention: DMAX < DMIN, 
    DMEAN <  (smaller of DMIN and DMAX), and  
    RMS < 0 each indicate that the quantity in question is not well 
    determined. However RELION (and possibly CryoSPARC do not
    accept these values sometimes. </p>
