<li>Purpose<br>
 The purpose of VolCorr and VCWH is to create control points to
align two 3D double-tilt reconstructions of the same object created
by SPIDER. Often, reconstructions of the same object after a 90
degree rotation have noticeable differences in the location of
organelles, regions, etc. that can not be explained. This group of
programs select regions in one reconstruction, and then search for
and return the placement of the best fit of the region in the
second reconstruction. The position of the searched for regions in
each volume is output as a document file, VCOutput.bat. At the time
of writing this, modification of a warp program is underway to
perform the actual warping, using this information.</li>

<li>Assumptions/Caveats/Warnings<br>
 

<ol>
<li>The two reconstructions(volumes) to be compared must be of the
same size. This should not be a problem considering the two volumes
are of the same object.</li>

<li>The volumes should be aligned in the same direction. There is a
built in limitation of how far the program will search for the best
fit region in the second volume. This limit is based on how many
partitions are created(see 2.1 and 3.0 326-58). Alignment should be
based on real life arrangement of the sample.</li>

<li>Only translation is accounted for. If you have reason to
believe that there is large scale rotation BETWEEN your volumes,
consult Bimal's paper/program(see 4.0).</li>

<li>This program searches and correlates REGIONS of space. This
takes into accounts specific organelles, local regions, as well as
background density. It selects the search region from the first
volume, and finds the best fit of the entire region, within a
certain distance. If you are trying to find certain objects or
organelles, look at Bimal's paper/program(see 4.0).</li>

<li>That all three files and test data are in the same folder. If
not, you may have to type in file names accordingly different.</li>

<li>Any other applicable limitations either of Bimal's work or
Roseman's paper (see 4.0).</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Directions For Daily Use<br>
 What follows is a list of general steps on how to manipulate a
reconstruction, to produce the best correlations and why. It is
based only on my experience and therefore may include extra, or
accidentally omit, steps that you might find useful. The entire
purpose of steps (1.3.1 to 1.3.6)is to align the volumes correctly
and remove random noise in each reconstruction. 

<ol>
<li>Obtain two(or more) 3D reconstructions of the same sample.
There is no reason that I know of why they could not be single
tilt, other than they contain less information.</li>

<li>View the volumes, in their entirity, either with WEB or some
other program. The purpose of this is to insure that the volumes
are aligned in the same manner. If not, use RT 90 in SPIDER to
align if at all possible. RT 90 preserves more information than
other rotate commands.</li>

<li>After you are sure that the volumes are aligned properly, use
the Commands-&gt;Histogram option in WEB to view the histogram of
each volume. Take note of the PERCENTAGE where the bell curve shape
become too elongated on either end for each volume. It should be
roughly the same for each. In my experience, the gold specks that
are used in the samples drastically skew the histogram tails
outward. This forces a limited number of grey scales to represent
the full spread of density values. Resulting in the usable sample
information contained in a very small amount of the grey scale, so
that you can not see where the "noise" ends and the true
information begins. This knowledge is used later.</li>

<li>With the percentage values required to make each volume's
histogram more "bell-curvy" open hc.bat.</li>

<li>Change the name directly after[infile] to the full path name
needed to find the first volume.</li>

<li>Change after [outfile] to the name and location of where the
"compressed" image will be made. This needs to be a different name
than the source because a)SPIDER won't rewrite the source and b)the
source will be used later.</li>

<li>Change the values of x50,x51 to that the needed % values are in
DECIMAL form, 58% = 0.58</li>

<li>Run hc.bat from SPIDER</li>

<li>View the new volumes in WEB. Select the points(slices) where
the noise stops, and useful information begins. It is my experince
that the most noise only occurs in the top or bottom slices, the
sides are relatively usefull. If this is not the case for you,
remove ANY large amounts of noise. This program is not designed to
compare random noise. The amount of noisy slices removed from each
volume should be equal. Equal because VolCorr requires volumes to
be the same size, and if you remove uneven amounts, but still have
the same size volumes, you are no longer comparing pixels
correctly. This also typically removes the gold specks because they
are usually found only in the noise region. A slight loss of useful
data is allowable in order to remove more extreme data(gold specks
and shadows).</li>

<li>Using the SPIDER WIndow command, select the correct slices from
the ORIGINAL (aligned, but not compressed) volumes, and save as new
files. These new files are what will be compared. The reason you
remove from the aligned, but not compressed file, is that you
compare pure data. No noise AND no artifacts from
thresholding.</li>

<li>Because VolCorr is a procedure file, you must alter the file
itself, no arguments allowed. In order to make that safer, ONLY
CHANGE THINGS BETWEEN THE ----ALL INPUTS--- and ---END ALL
INPUTS--- lines.</li>

<li>The name/path after [secondary] is the file that the
searched-for regions will come from.</li>

<li>After [primary] is the file that the regions will be
searched-in for. Which file is first or second is important because
the output of VolCorr is where the points in [secondary] can be
found in [primary]. This determines if you want to warp file 2 to
look like file 1, or vise versa.</li>

<li>The value after "x91 =" sets the minimum value for a pixel to
be searched for. For example, if you run SPIDER's FS and set the
"x91 =" value to the maximum valueof a volume, then no pixels will
be searched for. A good rule of thumb is around 10% of the
difference between the maximum and minimum. This value has a large
effect on correlations, so if you're having problems forming
reasonable correlations, examine this value.</li>

<li>The next three variables determine the number of search
regions. The number of divisions(regions) in a dimension determines
how many spaces it creates in that dimension. Thus, all three
multiplied together are how many regions there are in all. See Sec.
2.1 for more in depth explanation.</li>

<li>The last three are used to determine the size of each search
region. Similar to the number of regions, multiply these values
together to find the volume of each region.</li>

<li>General Explanation - Partitions, Search Regions, and Jump
Values (Oh My!)<br>
 

<ol>
<li>After many iterations of this program, I realized that a
point-centric model was the most efficient way to determine and
maintain the multiple spaces that are needed. The term
point-centric pertains to the method of creating and locating the
search regions in their respective partitions. The method
determines the center of a search region or partition, and then
expands from this central point, to create the space. This is
instead of SPIDER's inherent system of defining the upper-left
corner, then expanding from that. For variables x77-9 the term
divisions is used. The easiest way of visualizing divisions is to
imagine a cake. Each variable describes how many divisions in a
particular dimension will be made. If x77 = 3, then there will be
two cuts made. Resulting in three slices, or divisions, of cake in
the X direction. This same thought process can be used for Y and Z
dimensions as well. It follows that if there is 3,5,and 7 divisions
in the X,Y, and Z dimensions that there will be 3*5*7=105 pieces of
cake, or partitions. In order for the point-centric model to be
useful, there must be one point, or voxel, that is the center of
each partition. To insure this, there are tests to force each
division, and therefor each partition, height to be an odd number.
This central voxel of the partition is also the center point of a
search region. Using the variables that are responsible for "cube
size", the search cube is developed by expanding out from the
center voxel. If x80 = 11, the X size of the search cube is
(central point's x value minus five) to (central point's x value
plus five). In this way, the point-centric method forces the search
cube, and it's respective partition, to be co-centric.</li>

<li>With the coordinates of the search region defined, it is copied
out from the secondary volume and transformed into Fourier space.
Then the respective partition is copied out of the primary volume
and also changed into Fourier space. They are then compared to each
other, and the distance between their best fit's are calculated.
This distance is returnedas the output. A simple test is to compare
a file to itself. The two points should be identical, as long as
there is a minimum of white noise, and therefore a distnce of 0
returned.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Programmer level documentation 

<p>What follows is a VERY rough, line-by-line account of what is
going on, and why.</p>

<p>VolCorr.bat</p>

<ul>
<li>42-85 The point-centric method requires everything to be odd,
for one central voxel</li>

<li>84-119 One of the primary assumptions is that the files are
aligned correctly.</li>

<li>121-135 Point centric: partition height = volume height/ # of
divisions wanted, then make sure it's odd</li>

<li>137-140 Calculate the center of the partition: partition
height/2 the 0.5 insures the center</li>

<li>142-171 Insure that the search cube isn't larger than it's
partition</li>

<li>173-176 For print out, just to know how much of the volume is
included in the search cubes.</li>

<li>178-181 Space between divisions:= (volume height - total
partition height)/# of spaces between</li>

<li>219 Start VolCorrWorkHorse, see top of VolCorr for variable
explanation</li>
</ul>

 VCWH.bat<br>
WARNING due to the many incarnations of this program, some comments
in VCWH may refer to similar things with different terminology than
used in this ReadMe. The process is correct, but the objects
affected may be different than how I describe them here. I wrote
this ReadMe to be the diffinitive explanation, it SHOULD supersede
any description in VCWH, but "caveat programmtor". 

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>12-14 CC stores results in the center of the image, need upper
left of center window</li>

<li>21-23 see 2.1, this is 0.5 of the search cube size, used to
"expand out"</li>

<li>26-43 similar to 142-171 above</li>

<li>48-63 write to results file info needed to display
movement</li>

<li style="list-style: none">vectors</li>

<li>67-72 one loop needed for each partition, or part of cake</li>

<li>75-77 for progress display purposes</li>

<li>79-87 using loop counters, selects the partition that will be
searched in, from primary = # of divisions-1* size of partitions +
space between partitions*spaces between</li>

<li>89-92 location of corresponding search cube =corner of
partition +center of partition- half the size of search cube</li>

<li>94-99 to change print out to final points instead of vectors,
x55=x52+x58</li>

<li>101-106 select partition, from primary</li>

<li>108-125 the actual theory is best described by others, see
Roseman's paper</li>

<li>127-131 WU=local.std.dev. returns in center, like CC, so need
upper left</li>

<li>133-137 before CC, must center the search cube in the
partition</li>

<li>139-144 select search cube from secondary</li>

<li>146-324 see Roseman's paper</li>

<li>326-358 this is what actually limits max. distance the search
cube can be from the expected position</li>

<li>365-372 looking for the highest points of correlation</li>

<li>374-391 Prints out only the highest point of correlation for
each partition/search cube. If more correlations are desired, place
a mini-do loop around all, and change the "1" from UD S to the loop
counter.</li>

<li>393-end file clean up, end of XYZ do loops, doesn't actually
delete output dir. Feel free to fix that.</li>
