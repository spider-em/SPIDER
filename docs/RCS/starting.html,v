<h2 align="CENTER">Getting Started with SPIDER</h2>

<p>
SPIDER provides a large <a href="operations_doc.html">Manual of
Operations</a>, each of which is documented in a separate manual
page. Nobody likes to read manuals. On the other hand, this is the
only way to make sure that the computer performs the operation you
are intending.
</p>

<p>A good way to start from scratch is the 
   <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start Guide</a>. The 
   <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> provides a more detailed survey of the
   many image and volume processing operations in SPIDER. In general,
   if you run into terms that you don't know, try the 
   <a href= "glossary.html">Glossary</a>. It provides simple explanations that
   may be sufficient for the time being. If you want to get into more
   detail, there is a number listed for each term in the glossary,
   referring to the page of the book: J. Frank <i>
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195182189/">
   Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies</a>
   Oxford University Press,  (February 2006)</i>
</p>

<p>After going through the tutorial, you should look at the formal
   description of the formats, rules and syntax, provided in the 
   <a href="user_doc.html">User's Guide</a>. This is a document that you
   will have to go back to frequently as you get more familiar with
   the SPIDER environment, especially if you want to use the language
   to the fullest extent, including nested procedures, do-loops,
   registers and document files.</p>

<p>Next, you may want to look under 
   "<a href="documents.html#3D">3D Techniques</a>". This part of the documentation
   goes into the detailed procedures that are used to accomplish a 3D
   reconstruction. Even if you are not interested in any particular
   approach, the procedure files performing the individual tasks, such
   as density normalization and alignment, will show you how operations
   are used in context.</p>

<p>When you are getting started, the alphabetic 
   <a href= "operations_doc.html">listing</a> of operations might not be
   especially useful, because you don't know the idiosyncratic names
   under which they can be found. We therefore have provided a 
   <a href="crossref.html">cross reference index</a> that helps you
   identify the relevant operations from an alphabetic listing.</p>
