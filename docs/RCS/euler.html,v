<h1 align="center">Euler angles in SPIDER &amp; Web</h1>

<p>The Euler angles in SPIDER &amp; Web are defined as three
  successive rotations in a right hand coordinate system. </p>

<ol>
  <li> First, the object is rotated CLOCKWISE around the Z-axis 
      (angle 'phi')</li>
  <li> Then it is rotated CLOCKWISE around the original
       Y-axis (angle 'theta')</li>
  <li> Finally, it is rotated CLOCKWISE around the original
       Z-axis (angle 'psi').</li>
</ol>

<p> All rotations are done around axes of the original SPACE coordinate
 system and direction of rotation is determined by looking to the origin.</p>

<p>Note: If a volume is displayed in Web as slices, the observed rotations 
  will be, COUNTERCLOCKWISE for 'phi' and 'psi' rotations around Z-axis and
  CLOCKWISE for 'theta' rotation around Y-axis.  Web displays a volume
  with first slice on top.</p>

<pre>
 
The rotation matrices used are defined as:

v = Rv', where  R is the matrix for transforming vector v' to vector v. 

R        = R(psi) * R(theta) * R(phi) 

R(psi)   =   cos(psi)  sin(psi)  0
            -sin(psi)  cos(psi)  0
                0         0      1   
             
R(theta) =   cos(theta)  0 -sin(theta)
                0        1     0
             sin(theta)  0  cos(theta)
             
R(phi)   =   cos(phi)  sin(phi)  0 
            -sin(phi)  cos(phi)  0 
                0         0      1

<p>The <a href="./man/rt3d.html">RT 3D</a> SPIDER operation was
