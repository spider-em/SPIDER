 CORAV.DOC  3/3/93  CORRELATION AVERAGING OF CRYSTALS
 ====================================================================

 Note: 4/7/93 the "WV P" option has a bug and is not working
       properly. It will be fixed in the next release

 
 This document is an introduction into correlation averaging of
 crystalline lattices using both global and patchwork averaging.
 
 
 1) OVERVIEW
 ===========
 
 The method of Correlation Averaging, in general, works on the
 principle of locating the precise position of each repeat within
 a crystal by cross-correlation with a reference. In this way,
 dislocations, fault lines, and any local translational variations
 in the position of the lattice repeat will not result in a resolution
 loss.
 
 After the peaks of the cross-correlation function have been located,
 there are two ways to proceed:
 
 A) Real-space averaging using a "hopping window" that is placed 
 into each of the peak positions (wherever the peak height exceeds
 a certain threshold) (SPIDER method and method adopted by Saxton);
 
 B) Fourier averaging after a process of "unbending" whereby the
 raw image is un-distorted so that the resulting image depicts the
 crystal in perfect order (MRC method, developed by Henderson).
 
 
 In Albany, the Real-space method is implemented.  The real-space
 summation of windows is done either globally, over the entire 
 field (WV) or locally, over each of a set of patches (WV P; patch-
 work averaging).  In the former case, a single average is produced;
 in the latter case, an entire set of averages is produced, one for 
 each patch.
 
 In the patchwork averaging, the set of averages is subjected to
 multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), and according to the
 results of this analysis, statistically meaningful subset averages
 are formed, each depicting the structure in a different state,
 conformation, or orientation.
 
 The global average or the subset averages can then be used to extract
 crystallographically meaningful information.
 
 ======================================================================
 ======================================================================
 
 2) OUTLINE OF THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS
 ===================================
 
    (STEPS (a) THROUGH (c) ARE SHARED BY GLOBAL AND PATCHWORK AVERAGING;
     STARTING WITH (d), THE TWO METHODS DIVERGE, TO COME BACK TOGETHER
     AGAIN IN STEP (e))
 
 a) prepare a reference. This is either a small subfield containing
    a well-ordered portion of the crystal (single-layer case), or
    a small subfield of a quasi-optically filtered version of the
    crystal (multiple-layer case).
 
 b) run procedure CORAV1. This pads the subfield into a field whose
    size matches the size of the raw data field (but only powers of
    two allowed, see below), computes the high-pass filtered CCF, 
    and produces a list of refined peak positions and heights, which 
    is stored in a document file. It also produces a version of the 
    CCF that has the peaks found overlaid.
 
 c) inspect the CCF in order to determine the sensible value range
    of the peaks to be used in correlation averaging. The CCF with
    overlayed peak map is displayed on the monitor with a special
    color table that allows the range to be assessed in one glance. 
 
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    GLOBAL:
    ======
 
 d) run WV. This produces a global average, or two subset averages
    picked according to even and odd peak numbers.
 
 
    PATCHWORK:
    =========
 
 d0) run WV P. Decide on a regular division of the field into patches.
     A set of "local" averages is produced, one for every patch.
 
 d1) display the local averages in the form of a patchwork. 
     Decide if the variations are strong enough to warrant application
     of MSA.  If not, then form the average of all patch averages, and
     proceed with step (e).
 
 d2) Submit the set of patch averages to MSA: CA SI (initialize), 
     then CA S (run CORAN), followed by CA SM (map). Inspect the map
     or maps for evidence of clustering or obvious data trends.
     If clustering suspected, run CA CLA.
 
 d3) Based on (d2), form subset averages by reconstitution (CA SR).
     These subset averages are virtually equivalent in terms of 
     statistical definition, to the global average resulting from
     global averaging.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 END OF SEPARATE BRANCH.  BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL AVERAGING CONTINUE HERE.
 
 
 e)  Extract crystallographic parameters from the average, or averages.
     This is done in the following steps:
        Mask file; Fourier-transform; run MMBOX (MRC) or an equivalent
         operation.
 
 ======================================================================
 ======================================================================
 
 3) THE STEPS IN DETAIL
 ======================
 
  a) prepare a reference
     ===================
 
 There are basically two kinds of references that can be used 
 for cross-correlating with the crystal field: either a 
 small, well-ordered subfield of the crystal or a small 
 subfield from a quasi-optically filtered Fourier average of 
 all or part of the crystal.  
 
 The unprocessed reference is adequate for single layer
 crystals with recognizable repeating units (i.e. good
 signal-to-noise situation). 
 
 However, if the contrast is low (frozen-hydrated or
 glucose-embedded specimens) or more than one independent
 crystal layer is present (collapsed membrane vesicle), a
 Fourier average should be used. 
 
 The reference subfield should contain 4-9 unit cells, i.e.
 one unit cell (centered) bounded by one-half to one unit
 cell in each lattice direction. 
 
 
 
 The first step in preparing a reference is to display the raw field 
 from which a subfield is to selected:
 
    In WEB/IMAGES:
    SHOW IMAGE: RAW001  (name of the "raw" field)
 
 
 Next, there are two optional ways to prepare a reference, as described 
 above:
 
 
 Option (i) To prepare an unprocessed subfield, simply window an
 appropriately sized section from a region of the crystal that appears
 to be representive and well-ordered. 
 
    In DRIVER:

        WI              ; window
    RAW001      ; input file
    REF001      ; reference file
    32,32       ; size of reference
    230,200     ; starting coos             
 
 
 
 Option (ii) To prepare a quasi-optically filtered subfield, the 
 procedures QUASIOPT1 and QUASIOPT2 are used in conjunction with 
 the operation WT TV.

        [the size of the subfield to be quasi-optically 
    filtered, restricted in this version to less than or 
    equal to 256 x 256.]

 5  ?POWER SPECTRUM?  POW001
    [the name of the power spectrum of the transform.]
 
 The subfield will be circularly padded into a 512 x 512
 file, transformed, and its power spectrum (diffraction
 pattern) created.  (The zero-order maximum in the power
 spectrum will also be masked out for display purposes.) 
 
 
 Next, the power spectrum is displayed on the workstation 
 monitor with WEB/IMAGES:
 
    SHOW IMAGE:  POW001
            
 If a well-ordered region of the crystal was chosen, the 
 power spectrum will contain strong, sharp maxima
 falling on one or more reciprocal lattices.  If the 
 diffraction pattern is not satisfactory, repeat QUASIOPT1
 for a different subfield.
 
 (It is possible to automatically determine the power spectrum for 
 subfields in the image using the EDIT/POWER SPECTRUM option in WEB.)

 At this point, the two-dimensional reciprocal lattice in the
 power spectrum must be indexed.  This can often be done
 visually on the monitor.  However, in the case of multiple
 crystal layers, a hard copy of the power spectrum may be
 needed to sort out the different lattices. 
 
 In WEB/IMAGES, select the REFLECTIONS option:

    DOCFILE:  DOC001    (name of file in which the indices and 
                coos of the selected reflections will be
                stored)

    KEY NUMBER:  1

    MARKER RAD:  5      (radius of circle in which the desired 
                reflection is located)


    Cursor is placed over a strong reflection with unambiguous 
    lattice indices and left button clicked.
 
    2,0     indices of this maximum are entered in box
                
    
    Cursor is clicked on 2nd reflection.
            
    2,2     indices of 2nd reflection entered
    .
    .        
    .

    Additional strong, unambiguous reflections are entered, at least 
    3 or 4 but the more the better.  (Be sure they are not all on 
    the same h,0 or 0,k lattice line.)  Click the right button after all 
    reflections are entered.
 

Next, return to DRIVER:

             size of box over which refinement will be done 
                        

    At this point the program will list 3 columns of coos:

                 Column 1 = entered coos
             Column 2 = coos transformed to reciprocal
                    space coo system, i.e. x* 
                    positive down, y* positive right) 
                     Column 3 = coos of pixel with highest value
                inside the box searched.)
    
    180    ; enter the maximum radius in Fourier 
             space to be searched for maxima (i.e. 
             usually the radius within which all the
             visible maxima in the power spectrum are
             contained)
             
             (At this point, the program returns 
             unit vector information first on a 
             crude lattice, then on the refined 
             lattice derived from the positions of 
             the entered maxima and those found inside 
             the maximum radius.  Refined parameters
             should be recorded for future reference.)
 
    FIL001     ; name of the filter file which will 
             contain information about the refined

    FIL001     ; name of filter file
    11     ; window size
  
 The program will window out the amplitudes and phases inside 
 an 11x11 box for each maximum at the coordinates specified by 
 the filter file.  These are stored in the RESULTS file, 
 which can be printed out and checked at this point.  In 
 general, most (70% or so) of the "energy" at each maximum
 should be contained in a 3x3 or 5x5 box centered on the
 indicated coordinates and the phases within the box should be
 relatively constant.  If this is not the case, double check
 your choice of reflections and indexing back in the REFLECTIONS option 
 of WEB.
 
 Now, the procedure QUASIOPT2 is run which applies a mask to 
 the Fourier transform (FOU001) passing only maxima and phases 
 at the coos specified by the filter file, FIL001, and then 
 calculates the inverse transform. The output file is a 
 quasi-optically filtered version of the original subfield.
 In addition, the power spectra of the filtered transform is
 computed (POG999) and may be examined with TV W.  (This is a fast way 
 to check the quality of the lattice mask.)

 b) run procedure CORAV1
    ====================
 
 Following are instructions on how to run the procedure CORAV1, which
 is used to produce the peak list from the raw data file and the
 reference file.  The actual procedure is listed at the end of this
 section.
 
 As the first step, the raw data file must be cut down to a size 
 that is equal or smaller than the working size.  The dimensions of 
 the working image must be powers of two. Use the window (WI) command.
 
 Let's say the dimensions of the original image (RAW001) are 894x1232. 
 The closest power-of-two dimensions are 1024x1024:
 
    WI        ; window
    RAW001    ; input file
    WIN001    ; subfield to be averaged
    894,1024  ; size of area cut out
    130,420   ; starting coos   
  
 Here the y-starting coo is chosen such that the strips cut off on 
 either side are equal.  Usually, the edges of the crystal field
 are of inferior quality, so if something needs to be sacrificed,
 it might as well be edge regions.
 
 Next, the procedure is called (the input statements are numbered
 consecutively):
 
    @@CORAV1
 
 1  ?WORKING DIM (POWERS OF 2)? 1024
    [the working size used in the procedure. Currently,
    this is laid out for square format only]
 
 2       ?RAW FIELD (DIMS .LE. WORKING DIMS)? WIN001
         [the image subfield created above]
 
 3       ?REFERENCE IMAGE? REF001
         [the image created in step (a) of this manual.
    This is allowed to have dimensions that are not 
    powers of two.]
 
 4  ?NAME OF CCF? CCF001
    [the name of the file where the CCF is to be stored.
    Even though the only important output of the procedure 
    is the peak list, obtained by searching the CCF, it
    is useful to save the CCF at least temporarily, to
    be able to repeat the peak search (PK C) operation with
    different values of the search parameters (e.g., neigh-
    borhood exclusion).] 
 
 The file CCF001 will now be created with working dims 1024,1024, 
 and the input image WIN001 will be padded into CCF001 in such
 a way that the margins are equal on both sides.
 
 Next, a file PIC999 is created with the same working dims, and
 the reference field REF001 is padded into PIC999, with the average 
 of REF001 used to fill the background. 
 
 Next, the two files CCF001 and PIC999 are cross-correlated.
 In the process of computing the CCF, a high-pass filter is
 applied:
 
 5  ?FOURIER RADIUS FOR CCF HIGH-PASS FILTRATION? 45.
    [the radius of a high-pass filter. This prevents back-
    ground fluctuations unrelated to the crystal structure
    from interfering with the peak ranking.  Be sure to
    chose a radius that is smaller than the smallest
    reciprocal vector, so that no first order reflection
    is eliminated.  To be sure, you may wish to check after-
    wards, by displaying the power spectrum of the FT of 
    the working file (to compute power spectrum, use PW).
 
 
 The CCF is stored in the file CCF001. This file is now searched 
 by operation PK C.  The next four questions have to do with 
 parameters of the searching: 
 
 6  ?MAX. NUMBER OF PEAKS EXPECTED? 1000
    [currently, the largest number that can be entered 
         here is 4000.  If a larger number is entered, it will be
         changed to 4000.  Peaks will be searched in the order of
         descending heights.  As a guide for the number of peaks,
         consider the number of unit cells that fit into the field
         analyzed, but increase this estimate, allowing for the fact 
         that a good number of incorrect peaks (not on the lattice) 
         will be found whose heights are larger than the heights of 
         some of the correct ones.]
 
 7  ?NEAREST NEIGHBOR EXCL. DIST.? 9
    [enter the radius of the neighborhood exclusion.  The
    significance of this parameter is as follows: for a
         peak to be accepted into the final list, which is written
         into the peak list file (a document file, see below), it 
         has to fulfill the following criteria:
 
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x+1,y)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x-1,y)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x,y+1)
    (i) p(x,y)&gt; p(x+1,y+1)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x-1,y+1)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x+1,y-1)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x,y-1)
        p(x,y)&gt; p(x-1,y-1)
    
 
    (ii)    (x-xn)**2 + (y-yn)**2 &gt; (neighborhood excl.)**2
 
    (iii)   x &gt; (x-exclusion)
        x &lt; NSAM-(x-exclusion)
        y &gt; (y-exclusion)
        y &lt; NROW-(y-exclusion)
 
    Condition (i) is the basic 8-neighbor criterion. 
 
    Condition (ii) eliminates peaks that lie so close to peaks
    already found that they cannot be possibly on the same
    lattice. This exclusion works on the assumption that the
         initial list of    peaks already found is correct.  Under
    unfortunate circumstances, it may cause the search to
    "lock" into an incorrect lattice, or exclude a portion
    of the correct lattice around a high artifactual peak.
 
    Condition (iii) requires no decision, but follows from the
    geometry of the correlation search, which requires exclusion
    of a margin whose size is equal to half the size of the
    reference plus any padding around WIN001.]
 
 8  ?NAME OF PEAK FILE? DOC010
    [enter the name of the document file into which the peak
    values will be written.  The important parameters to be
    picked up later by PP as well as WV are 
 
        KEY, XPOS, YPOS, HEIGHT
 
    where   KEY is the peak with rank KEY in the list of
            all peaks that have passed conditions (i), 
            (ii), and (iii);
        XPOS    is the x-position of the peak relative
            to the origin of the working field;
        YPOS    is the y-position
        HEIGHT  is the absolute height of the peak.]
 
 
 After the peak list has been obtained, it is used to make two
 point maps (using operation PP), which give a survey of peaks found
 and allows a judgement to be made if the peaks, or a subset
 are lying on the lattice.  The first map has the points superimposed
 on the CCF. The second map shows the peaks against a uniform background.
 
 
 9  ?CCF/PEAK MAP? CCP001
    [the name of the file where the modified CCF with peaks
    overlaid is to be stored. This file is used in step (c)
    below to assess the peak value range to be used in
    the averaging step (step (d)).]
 
 10 ?RANGE OF PEAKS TO BE MARKED (e.g., 1-500)? 1-1000
    [give the range of peaks to be marked as points in the 
         CCF/PEAK map.]
 
 11     ?PLAIN PEAK MAP?  MAP001
            [the name of the point map with a uniform background. 
    This map is useful for assessing lattice order.]
 
 ================================================================
 
 
 3) c) interactive assessment of peak range
       ====================================
 
 The CCF/PEAK map is identical to the CCF except that in each of 
 the peak positions found and selected for marking, a single 
 point with highest intensity is inserted.  This point appears
 white on a normal display with TV W.  In order to assess the
 useful value range of the peaks, the CCF/PEAK map must be
 displayed with the color table CAM02.  This has the value range
 between MAX and MIN equally divided into 8 colors.  In descending
 order, the colors are:
 
        WHITE
        YELLOW
        ORANGE
        RED
        PURPLE
        VIOLET
        BLUE
        BLACK
 
 In addition, the peaks selected are marked with a GREEN point in
 the center.

 AVERAGING PROCEDURES
 ====================
 
    At this point, the user has the choice of making a global average
 using the operation WV or proceding with a patchwork analysis of local
 averages in the crystal field.   
 
 
 3) d) global average
       ==============
 
    The operation WV can be used to sum windows extracted from the entire 
 field specified in CORAV1 at the coos contained in the peak list file:
 
    
    WV  ; Window aVerage
    PIC999  ; The padded version of the raw field produced
          in CORAV1
    AVE001  ; Name of correlation average file
    32,32   ; Dimensions of average 
    DOC010  ; Name of file containing peak list
    1-250   ; Peaks to be included in average
    N   ; Fix the number of peaks (Y/N)?  Peaks that are too
          close to the edge of the field are rejected.  "Y"    
          causes additional peaks to be included in the average
          to compensate for those skipped
    1   ; Peak number increment: 1= use each peak in order
                     2= use every 2nd peak, etc.
    Y   ; Make "control windows", i.e. image files containing 
          the areas windowed-out 
    1   ; Control interval, i.e. make a control window for:
          1= every peak used, 2= every 2nd peak used, etc.
    WND***  ; Prefix of control windows
 
 
 
    The decision of how many peaks to use in the final average may be based
 on examination of the peak maps generated in CORAV1 or by information in
 the peak list file (e.g. the user may decide to use only peaks with a 
 relative or absolute height greater than some cutoff).
    
    A more general approach is to make control windows for all the 
 peaks in the peak list file and to use an objective criterion to decide
 at which peak number inclusion of additional peaks no longer improves
 the quality of the average.  For this, the procedures CORAV2, CORAV3, 
 CORAV4 are used.  CORAV2 makes an odd and an even series of images from

 subaverages from the windows, each i-th subaverage containing the first
 i*100 windows in its respective series (i.e. odd or even), CORAV4

   The three columns in the DOC file correspond to:

            2=1st 400 windows, 200 odd + 200 even...)
    2) the inner radius of the annulus (3 Fourier units wide)
       in which the phase residual is calculated    
    3) the phase residual in the annulus.
    
   Examination of the results in the DOC file indicates at which point
 inclusion of groups of windows (subaverages) corresponding to higher
 peak numbers no longer improves the agreement between the ODD and EVN
 series (i.e. phase residuals no longer decrease and may increase).  Once
 this number of peaks is determined, AS may be used to make a final
 average using only the corresponding number of control windows. (For
 example, if phase residuals increase from i = 6 to i = 7, the number of 
 peaks that should be included in the final average is (6 x 50) x 2 =
 600.) 
 
 
 
 3) d) analysis by patchwork averaging
       ===============================
 
 This computation consists of four steps: 
 
    compute set of averages
    display set of averages and decide if the next two steps needed
    use MSA (and classification if required)
    compute reconstituted images
 
 d0) Compute set of averages.
     =======================
 
 First, decide on the size of patches to be used. For frozen-hydrated
 material, around 200 unit cells should be in a patch.  For stained
 material, a much smaller number still works; e.g., 50.
 
 Now, run the procedure PATCHAV.  According to the number of patches
 across the scanned data file, the field is subdivided into square
 patches.

 Check the RESULTS file for the number of peaks left over as the
 program passes through various steps of selection. These selection 
 steps are:
 
    value range
    rank range (unused in above example)
    eliminate peaks within margin
    check if total number exceeds total specified by user
 
 At the very end of the RESULTS listing, the numbers of windows
 actually used for each patch are listed. This number varies from
 one patch to the other because of the difference in quality,
 which is reflected in a difference in the number of peaks found 
 in step (3b) or in the number of peaks passed in the above four 
 selection steps of the patchwork averaging procedure.
 
 
 d1) Display the set of averages stored in AVG001 as a montage,
     by placing each average into a position that corresponds
     to the position of its associated patch.  This is done in
     DRIVERW either by applying TV M (interactive montage) directly 
     to the 3-D file, or by extracting the averages by a PS Z
     (pick slice in z-direction) operation.
 
 Direct display:

    &lt;CR&gt;  ; default display origin
 
 
 The resulting montage will appear on the screen.  Now check for
 presence of variations. Visual check may indicate absence of
 variations. In that case, proceed by summing the image series
 to obtain the global average, and skip the next two steps.
 
 d2) In the presence of variations, proceed by running
 an MSA analysis:  The initialization operation (CA SI) accepts
 both a file series and a 3-D formatted file, so it is not
 necessary to go through the step of PS Z file extraction.
 CA SI creates a single Sequential File in which each image
 of the series is stored as a single record.
  
 Immediately after the initialization, the actual analysis is
 run.

          the prefices IMC, PIX, and EIG. In our

          created.

 To interpret the results, the eigenvalue histogram, factor maps, 
 and selected reconstitutions are inspected.  Printouts of the
 eigenvalue histogram and selected factor maps are created by 
 operation CA SME, which can be run interactively:
 
    CA SME  ; create factor map
    I   ; map of images
    1,4 ; file code used in CA S, no. of patches across
    1,2 ; factors to be used

    &lt;CR&gt;  ; default handedness of map (no flipping)
    TITLE (up to 80 chars of title info to appear on map)
 
 The resulting eigenvalue histogram and the map selected will be
 written into the RESULTS file, and this can be printed on the
 line printer.

 CORAV.DOC  3/3/93	CORRELATION AVERAGING OF CRYSTALS
 ====================================================================

 Note: 4/7/93 the "WV P" option has a bug and is not working
       properly. It will be fixed in the next release

 
 This document is an introduction into correlation averaging of
 crystalline lattices using both global and patchwork averaging.
 
 
 1) OVERVIEW
 ===========
 
 The method of Correlation Averaging, in general, works on the
 principle of locating the precise position of each repeat within
 a crystal by cross-correlation with a reference. In this way,
 dislocations, fault lines, and any local translational variations
 in the position of the lattice repeat will not result in a resolution
 loss.
 
 After the peaks of the cross-correlation function have been located,
 there are two ways to proceed:
 
 A) Real-space averaging using a "hopping window" that is placed 
 into each of the peak positions (wherever the peak height exceeds
 a certain threshold) (SPIDER method and method adopted by Saxton);
 
 B) Fourier averaging after a process of "unbending" whereby the
 raw image is un-distorted so that the resulting image depicts the
 crystal in perfect order (MRC method, developed by Henderson).
 
 
 In Albany, the Real-space method is implemented.  The real-space
 summation of windows is done either globally, over the entire 
 field (WV) or locally, over each of a set of patches (WV P; patch-
 work averaging).  In the former case, a single average is produced;
 in the latter case, an entire set of averages is produced, one for 
 each patch.
 
 In the patchwork averaging, the set of averages is subjected to
 multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), and according to the
 results of this analysis, statistically meaningful subset averages
 are formed, each depicting the structure in a different state,
 conformation, or orientation.
 
 The global average or the subset averages can then be used to extract
 crystallographically meaningful information.
 
 ======================================================================
 ======================================================================
 
 2) OUTLINE OF THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS
 ===================================
 
    (STEPS (a) THROUGH (c) ARE SHARED BY GLOBAL AND PATCHWORK AVERAGING;
     STARTING WITH (d), THE TWO METHODS DIVERGE, TO COME BACK TOGETHER
     AGAIN IN STEP (e))
 
 a) prepare a reference. This is either a small subfield containing
    a well-ordered portion of the crystal (single-layer case), or
    a small subfield of a quasi-optically filtered version of the
    crystal (multiple-layer case).
 
 b) run procedure CORAV1. This pads the subfield into a field whose
    size matches the size of the raw data field (but only powers of
    two allowed, see below), computes the high-pass filtered CCF, 
    and produces a list of refined peak positions and heights, which 
    is stored in a document file. It also produces a version of the 
    CCF that has the peaks found overlaid.
 
 c) inspect the CCF in order to determine the sensible value range
    of the peaks to be used in correlation averaging. The CCF with
    overlayed peak map is displayed on the monitor with a special
    color table that allows the range to be assessed in one glance. 
 
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    GLOBAL:
    ======
 
 d) run WV. This produces a global average, or two subset averages
    picked according to even and odd peak numbers.
 
 
    PATCHWORK:
    =========
 
 d0) run WV P. Decide on a regular division of the field into patches.
     A set of "local" averages is produced, one for every patch.
 
 d1) display the local averages in the form of a patchwork. 
     Decide if the variations are strong enough to warrant application
     of MSA.  If not, then form the average of all patch averages, and
     proceed with step (e).
 
 d2) Submit the set of patch averages to MSA: CA SI (initialize), 
     then CA S (run CORAN), followed by CA SM (map). Inspect the map
     or maps for evidence of clustering or obvious data trends.
     If clustering suspected, run CA CLA.
 
 d3) Based on (d2), form subset averages by reconstitution (CA SR).
     These subset averages are virtually equivalent in terms of 
     statistical definition, to the global average resulting from
     global averaging.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 END OF SEPARATE BRANCH.  BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL AVERAGING CONTINUE HERE.
 
 
 e)  Extract crystallographic parameters from the average, or averages.
     This is done in the following steps:
    	Mask file; Fourier-transform; run MMBOX (MRC) or an equivalent
         operation.
 
 ======================================================================
 ======================================================================
 
 3) THE STEPS IN DETAIL
 ======================
 
  a) prepare a reference
     ===================
 
 There are basically two kinds of references that can be used 
 for cross-correlating with the crystal field: either a 
 small, well-ordered subfield of the crystal or a small 
 subfield from a quasi-optically filtered Fourier average of 
 all or part of the crystal.  
 
 The unprocessed reference is adequate for single layer
 crystals with recognizable repeating units (i.e. good
 signal-to-noise situation). 
 
 However, if the contrast is low (frozen-hydrated or
 glucose-embedded specimens) or more than one independent
 crystal layer is present (collapsed membrane vesicle), a
 Fourier average should be used. 
 
 The reference subfield should contain 4-9 unit cells, i.e.
 one unit cell (centered) bounded by one-half to one unit
 cell in each lattice direction. 
 
 
 
 The first step in preparing a reference is to display the raw field 
 from which a subfield is to selected:
 
 	In WEB/IMAGES:
 	SHOW IMAGE: RAW001	(name of the "raw" field)
 
 
 Next, there are two optional ways to prepare a reference, as described 
 above:
 
 
 Option (i) To prepare an unprocessed subfield, simply window an
 appropriately sized section from a region of the crystal that appears
 to be representive and well-ordered. 
 
	In DRIVER:

        WI              ; window
 	RAW001  	; input file
 	REF001		; reference file
 	32,32		; size of reference
 	230,200		; starting coos		       	
 
 
 
 Option (ii) To prepare a quasi-optically filtered subfield, the 
 procedures QUASIOPT1 and QUASIOPT2 are used in conjunction with 
 the operation WT TV.
 
	
 	MD		; Mode
 	TR ON		; Trace on (to see the steps in the procedure 
 			  as they are executed)
 	
 
 	@@QUASIOPT1
 
 1	?RAW IMAGE?  RAW001
 	[the name of the image file from which a subfield is
         to be selected for filtering.]
 
 2	?FINAL SIZE?  256,256
       	[the size of the subfield to be quasi-optically 
 	filtered, restricted in this version to less than or 
 	equal to 256 x 256.]
 
 3	?UPPER LEFT COOS?  230,200
 	[the starting coos in the raw field.]
 
 4	?FOURIER FILE?  FOU001
 	[the name of the Fourier transformed subfield.]
 
 5	?POWER SPECTRUM?  POW001
 	[the name of the power spectrum of the transform.]
 
 The subfield will be circularly padded into a 512 x 512
 file, transformed, and its power spectrum (diffraction
 pattern) created.  (The zero-order maximum in the power
 spectrum will also be masked out for display purposes.) 
 
 
 Next, the power spectrum is displayed on the workstation 
 monitor with WEB/IMAGES:
 
 	SHOW IMAGE:  POW001
 			
 If a well-ordered region of the crystal was chosen, the 
 power spectrum will contain strong, sharp maxima
 falling on one or more reciprocal lattices.  If the 
 diffraction pattern is not satisfactory, repeat QUASIOPT1
 for a different subfield.
 
 (It is possible to automatically determine the power spectrum for 
 subfields in the image using the EDIT/POWER SPECTRUM option in WEB.)

 At this point, the two-dimensional reciprocal lattice in the
 power spectrum must be indexed.  This can often be done
 visually on the monitor.  However, in the case of multiple
 crystal layers, a hard copy of the power spectrum may be
 needed to sort out the different lattices. 
 
 In WEB/IMAGES, select the REFLECTIONS option:

 	DOCFILE:  DOC001	(name of file in which the indices and 
				coos of the selected reflections will be
				stored)

	KEY NUMBER:  1

	MARKER RAD:  5		(radius of circle in which the desired 
				reflection is located)


	Cursor is placed over a strong reflection with unambiguous 
	lattice indices and left button clicked.
 
	2,0	   	indices of this maximum are entered in box
              	
	
	Cursor is clicked on 2nd reflection.
 			
 	2,2	   	indices of 2nd reflection entered
 	.
 	.        
	.

	Additional strong, unambiguous reflections are entered, at least 
	3 or 4 but the more the better.  (Be sure they are not all on 
	the same h,0 or 0,k lattice line.)  Click the right button after all 
	reflections are entered.
 

Next, return to DRIVER:

 	WT TV
 	POW001	   ; power spectrum	
 	FOU001	   ; Fourier transform
	DOC001     ; file containing lattice indexing information		
 	7,5	   ; size of box in reciprocal space in which	
 		     a search will be made for true maxima,
 		     size of box over which refinement will be done	
                      	

	At this point the program will list 3 columns of coos:

 	             Column 1 = entered coos
 		     Column 2 = coos transformed to reciprocal
 			        space coo system, i.e. x* 
 			        positive down, y* positive right) 
                     Column 3 = coos of pixel with highest value
 				inside the box searched.)
 	
 	180	   ; enter the maximum radius in Fourier 
 		     space to be searched for maxima (i.e. 
 		     usually the radius within which all the
 		     visible maxima in the power spectrum are
 		     contained)
 		     
 		     (At this point, the program returns 
 		     unit vector information first on a 
 		     crude lattice, then on the refined 
 		     lattice derived from the positions of 
 		     the entered maxima and those found inside 
 		     the maximum radius.  Refined parameters
 		     should be recorded for future reference.)
 
 	FIL001	   ; name of the filter file which will 
 		     contain information about the refined 
 		     lattice
 
 
 
 Next, FL may be used to check the refined lattice.
 
 	FL	   ; Fourier list
 	FOU001	   ; name of transform of subfield
 	F	   ; file-select mode
	1	   ; scaling factor 
	FIL001	   ; name of filter file
 	11	   ; window size
  
 The program will window out the amplitudes and phases inside 
 an 11x11 box for each maximum at the coordinates specified by 
 the filter file.  These are stored in the RESULTS file, 
 which can be printed out and checked at this point.  In 
 general, most (70% or so) of the "energy" at each maximum
 should be contained in a 3x3 or 5x5 box centered on the
 indicated coordinates and the phases within the box should be
 relatively constant.  If this is not the case, double check
 your choice of reflections and indexing back in the REFLECTIONS option 
 of WEB.
 
 Now, the procedure QUASIOPT2 is run which applies a mask to 
 the Fourier transform (FOU001) passing only maxima and phases 
 at the coos specified by the filter file, FIL001, and then 
 calculates the inverse transform. The output file is a 
 quasi-optically filtered version of the original subfield.
 In addition, the power spectra of the filtered transform is
 computed (POG999) and may be examined with TV W.  (This is a fast way 
 to check the quality of the lattice mask.)
 
 
 	@@QUASIOPT2

 	[name of transform of subfield being filtered]
 
 2	?FILTER FILE?  FIL001

 3	?MASK SIZE?  3

 	"energy" at each maximum, usually 3x3 or 5x5]
 
 4	?OUTPUT FILE?  OUT001
 	[name of filtered output file]
 	
 
 Now, an appropriate reference subfield may be windowed out 
 of the filtered field using WEB/IMAGES:  


	SHOW IMAGE:		OUT001

	WINDOW FILE/FIXED SIZE:	32,32

	Position box on filtered crystal image so that it is centered on 
	one unit cell.  Best region is normally at the middle of the 
	filtered field.  Push left button on mouse.
 
	WINDOW FILE NAME:   	REF001

 	Press right button on mouse to end windowing operation.

	
	SHOW IMAGE:		REF001 	 (display the reference field; repeat
 		                          windowing procedure if unit cell 
                                          poorly centered).
 
 
 b) run procedure CORAV1
    ====================
 
 Following are instructions on how to run the procedure CORAV1, which
 is used to produce the peak list from the raw data file and the
 reference file.  The actual procedure is listed at the end of this
 section.
 
 As the first step, the raw data file must be cut down to a size 
 that is equal or smaller than the working size.  The dimensions of 
 the working image must be powers of two. Use the window (WI) command.
 
 Let's say the dimensions of the original image (RAW001) are 894x1232. 
 The closest power-of-two dimensions are 1024x1024:
 
 	WI        ; window
 	RAW001    ; input file
 	WIN001    ; subfield to be averaged
 	894,1024  ; size of area cut out
 	130,420	  ; starting coos	
  
 Here the y-starting coo is chosen such that the strips cut off on 
 either side are equal.  Usually, the edges of the crystal field
 are of inferior quality, so if something needs to be sacrificed,
 it might as well be edge regions.
 
 Next, the procedure is called (the input statements are numbered
 consecutively):
 
 	@@CORAV1
 
 1	?WORKING DIM (POWERS OF 2)? 1024
 	[the working size used in the procedure. Currently,
 	this is laid out for square format only]
 
 2       ?RAW FIELD (DIMS .LE. WORKING DIMS)? WIN001
         [the image subfield created above]
 
 3       ?REFERENCE IMAGE? REF001
         [the image created in step (a) of this manual.
 	This is allowed to have dimensions that are not 
 	powers of two.]
 
 4	?NAME OF CCF? CCF001
 	[the name of the file where the CCF is to be stored.
 	Even though the only important output of the procedure 
 	is the peak list, obtained by searching the CCF, it
 	is useful to save the CCF at least temporarily, to
 	be able to repeat the peak search (PK C) operation with
 	different values of the search parameters (e.g., neigh-
 	borhood exclusion).] 
 
 The file CCF001 will now be created with working dims 1024,1024, 
 and the input image WIN001 will be padded into CCF001 in such
 a way that the margins are equal on both sides.
 
 Next, a file PIC999 is created with the same working dims, and
 the reference field REF001 is padded into PIC999, with the average 
 of REF001 used to fill the background. 
 
 Next, the two files CCF001 and PIC999 are cross-correlated.
 In the process of computing the CCF, a high-pass filter is
 applied:
 
 5	?FOURIER RADIUS FOR CCF HIGH-PASS FILTRATION? 45.
 	[the radius of a high-pass filter. This prevents back-
 	ground fluctuations unrelated to the crystal structure
 	from interfering with the peak ranking.  Be sure to
 	chose a radius that is smaller than the smallest
 	reciprocal vector, so that no first order reflection
 	is eliminated.  To be sure, you may wish to check after-
 	wards, by displaying the power spectrum of the FT of 
 	the working file (to compute power spectrum, use PW).
 
 
 The CCF is stored in the file CCF001. This file is now searched 
 by operation PK C.  The next four questions have to do with 
 parameters of the searching: 
 
 6	?MAX. NUMBER OF PEAKS EXPECTED? 1000
 	[currently, the largest number that can be entered 
         here is 4000.  If a larger number is entered, it will be
         changed to 4000.  Peaks will be searched in the order of
         descending heights.  As a guide for the number of peaks,
         consider the number of unit cells that fit into the field
         analyzed, but increase this estimate, allowing for the fact 
         that a good number of incorrect peaks (not on the lattice) 
         will be found whose heights are larger than the heights of 
         some of the correct ones.]
 
 7	?NEAREST NEIGHBOR EXCL. DIST.? 9
 	[enter the radius of the neighborhood exclusion.  The
 	significance of this parameter is as follows: for a
         peak to be accepted into the final list, which is written
         into the peak list file (a document file, see below), it 
         has to fulfill the following criteria:
 
 		p(x,y)> p(x+1,y)
 		p(x,y)> p(x-1,y)
 		p(x,y)> p(x,y+1)
 	(i)	p(x,y)> p(x+1,y+1)
 		p(x,y)> p(x-1,y+1)
 		p(x,y)> p(x+1,y-1)
 		p(x,y)> p(x,y-1)
 		p(x,y)> p(x-1,y-1)
 	
 
 	(ii)    (x-xn)**2 + (y-yn)**2 > (neighborhood excl.)**2
 
 	(iii)	x > (x-exclusion)
 		x < NSAM-(x-exclusion)
 		y > (y-exclusion)
 		y < NROW-(y-exclusion)
 
 	Condition (i) is the basic 8-neighbor criterion. 
 
 	Condition (ii) eliminates peaks that lie so close to peaks
 	already found that they cannot be possibly on the same
 	lattice. This exclusion works on the assumption that the
         initial list of	peaks already found is correct.  Under
 	unfortunate circumstances, it may cause the search to
 	"lock" into an incorrect lattice, or exclude a portion
 	of the correct lattice around a high artifactual peak.
 
 	Condition (iii) requires no decision, but follows from the
 	geometry of the correlation search, which requires exclusion
 	of a margin whose size is equal to half the size of the
 	reference plus any padding around WIN001.]
 
 8	?NAME OF PEAK FILE? DOC010
 	[enter the name of the document file into which the peak
 	values will be written.  The important parameters to be
 	picked up later by PP as well as WV are 
 
 		KEY, XPOS, YPOS, HEIGHT
 
 	where   KEY	is the peak with rank KEY in the list of
 			all peaks that have passed conditions (i), 
 			(ii), and (iii);
 		XPOS 	is the x-position of the peak relative
 			to the origin of the working field;
 		YPOS	is the y-position
 		HEIGHT	is the absolute height of the peak.]
 
 
 After the peak list has been obtained, it is used to make two
 point maps (using operation PP), which give a survey of peaks found
 and allows a judgement to be made if the peaks, or a subset
 are lying on the lattice.  The first map has the points superimposed
 on the CCF. The second map shows the peaks against a uniform background.
 
 
 9	?CCF/PEAK MAP? CCP001
 	[the name of the file where the modified CCF with peaks
 	overlaid is to be stored. This file is used in step (c)
 	below to assess the peak value range to be used in
 	the averaging step (step (d)).]
 
 10	?RANGE OF PEAKS TO BE MARKED (e.g., 1-500)? 1-1000
 	[give the range of peaks to be marked as points in the 
         CCF/PEAK map.]
 
 11  	?PLAIN PEAK MAP?  MAP001
        	[the name of the point map with a uniform background. 
 	This map is useful for assessing lattice order.]
 
 ================================================================
 
 
 3) c) interactive assessment of peak range
       ====================================
 
 The CCF/PEAK map is identical to the CCF except that in each of 
 the peak positions found and selected for marking, a single 
 point with highest intensity is inserted.  This point appears
 white on a normal display with TV W.  In order to assess the
 useful value range of the peaks, the CCF/PEAK map must be
 displayed with the color table CAM02.  This has the value range
 between MAX and MIN equally divided into 8 colors.  In descending
 order, the colors are:
 
 		WHITE
 		YELLOW
 		ORANGE
 		RED
 		PURPLE
 		VIOLET
 		BLUE
 		BLACK
 
 In addition, the peaks selected are marked with a GREEN point in
 the center.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------		  
 
 
 AVERAGING PROCEDURES
 ====================
 
    At this point, the user has the choice of making a global average
 using the operation WV or proceding with a patchwork analysis of local
 averages in the crystal field.   
 
 
 3) d) global average
       ==============
 
    The operation WV can be used to sum windows extracted from the entire 
 field specified in CORAV1 at the coos contained in the peak list file:
 
    
 	WV	; Window aVerage
 	PIC999	; The padded version of the raw field produced
 		  in CORAV1
 	AVE001	; Name of correlation average file
 	32,32	; Dimensions of average 
 	DOC010	; Name of file containing peak list
 	1-250	; Peaks to be included in average
 	N	; Fix the number of peaks (Y/N)?  Peaks that are too
 		  close to the edge of the field are rejected.  "Y"    
 		  causes additional peaks to be included in the average
 		  to compensate for those skipped
 	1	; Peak number increment: 1= use each peak in order
  					 2= use every 2nd peak, etc.
 	Y	; Make "control windows", i.e. image files containing 
 		  the areas windowed-out 
 	1	; Control interval, i.e. make a control window for:
 		  1= every peak used, 2= every 2nd peak used, etc.
 	WND***	; Prefix of control windows
 
 
 
    The decision of how many peaks to use in the final average may be based
 on examination of the peak maps generated in CORAV1 or by information in
 the peak list file (e.g. the user may decide to use only peaks with a 
 relative or absolute height greater than some cutoff).
    
    A more general approach is to make control windows for all the 
 peaks in the peak list file and to use an objective criterion to decide
 at which peak number inclusion of additional peaks no longer improves
 the quality of the average.  For this, the procedures CORAV2, CORAV3, 
 CORAV4 are used.  CORAV2 makes an odd and an even series of images from
 the control windows, CORAV3 makes a series of  masked odd/even
 subaverages from the windows, each i-th subaverage containing the first
 i*100 windows in its respective series (i.e. odd or even), CORAV4 
 finally calculates phase residuals between the cumulative odd and even
 sums: 
 
 	@@CORAV2
 
 1	?TOTAL NUMBER OF PEAKS (TO NEAREST 100) TO BE USED?  800
 	[this must be .le. number of peaks specified in WV]


	@@CORAV3

 1	?NUMBER OF SUBAVERAGES DESIRED PER ODD/EVEN SERIES?  4
	[enter number of averages to be created per series]

 2	?AVERAGING INCREMENT?  100
	[enter number of images per average]

 	@@CORAV4

 1	?NUMBER OF SUBAVERAGES PER ODD/EVEN SERIES?  4
	[re-enter the number of averages computed in CORAV3]

 2	?NAME OF DOC FILE TO CONTAIN RESULTS?  DOC100
 	[enter name of file to contain results]
 
 
   The three columns in the DOC file correspond to:
 	1) the index i (1=1st 200 windows, 100 odd + 100 even
 			2=1st 400 windows, 200 odd + 200 even...)
 	2) the inner radius of the annulus (3 Fourier units wide)
 	   in which the phase residual is calculated	
 	3) the phase residual in the annulus.
 	
   Examination of the results in the DOC file indicates at which point
 inclusion of groups of windows (subaverages) corresponding to higher
 peak numbers no longer improves the agreement between the ODD and EVN
 series (i.e. phase residuals no longer decrease and may increase).  Once
 this number of peaks is determined, AS may be used to make a final
 average using only the corresponding number of control windows. (For
 example, if phase residuals increase from i = 6 to i = 7, the number of 
 peaks that should be included in the final average is (6 x 50) x 2 =
 600.) 
 
 
 
 3) d) analysis by patchwork averaging
       ===============================
 
 This computation consists of four steps: 
 
 	compute set of averages
 	display set of averages and decide if the next two steps needed
 	use MSA (and classification if required)
 	compute reconstituted images
 
 d0) Compute set of averages.
     =======================
 
 First, decide on the size of patches to be used. For frozen-hydrated
 material, around 200 unit cells should be in a patch.  For stained
 material, a much smaller number still works; e.g., 50.
 
 Now, run the procedure PATCHAV.  According to the number of patches
 across the scanned data file, the field is subdivided into square
 patches.
 
 
 	@@PATCHAV
 1	?WORKING RAW DATA FILE? PIC999
 	[the working version of the raw data file, created by 
 	procedure CORAV1 in step (b)]
 
 2	?FILE TO STORE AVERAGE SET? AVG001
 	[name of the file where the average set is stored in 3-D
 	format]
 
 3	?DIMENSIONS OF AVERAGE (SQUARE FIELD)? 64
 	[self-explanatory. Give single number equal or close to the
 	size of the reference field]
 
 4	?NUMBER OF PATCHES ACROSS? 4
 	[this number determines the patch size and the total number
 	of patches used]
 
 5	?PEAK LIST FILE? DOC001
 	[the document file into which the peak coos have been saved
 	in the CORAV1 procedure, step (b)]
 
 6	?RANGE OF PEAK VALUES TO BE PASSED? 0.0,1.0
 	[this may be estimated from the false color display of the
 	CCF/PEAK map generated by CORAV1]
 
 
 
 Check the RESULTS file for the number of peaks left over as the
 program passes through various steps of selection. These selection 
 steps are:
 
 	value range
 	rank range (unused in above example)
 	eliminate peaks within margin
 	check if total number exceeds total specified by user
 
 At the very end of the RESULTS listing, the numbers of windows
 actually used for each patch are listed. This number varies from
 one patch to the other because of the difference in quality,
 which is reflected in a difference in the number of peaks found 
 in step (3b) or in the number of peaks passed in the above four 
 selection steps of the patchwork averaging procedure.
 
 
 d1) Display the set of averages stored in AVG001 as a montage,
     by placing each average into a position that corresponds
     to the position of its associated patch.  This is done in
     DRIVERW either by applying TV M (interactive montage) directly 
     to the 3-D file, or by extracting the averages by a PS Z
     (pick slice in z-direction) operation.
 
 Direct display:
 
 	TV M
 	AVG	; 3-letter prefix
 	1	; file number
	<CR>	; first and last x-column numbers to be displayed [all]
	<CR>	; first and last y-row numbers [all]
	1-16	; first and last z-slice numbers
	2,2	; x and y margins
	<CR>	; slice axis (x, y, or z) [z]
	<CR>	; normalize slice by slice? [no]
	4	; number of pictures per row; should correspond
 		  to the number of patches per row used in WV P.
	<CR>	; default display origin [0,0]

 Display after extracting images from 3-D file:
 
 	DO LB1 I=1,16
 	PS Z	; pick slice in z-direction
 	AVG001	; file name of 3-D file
 	PAT00I	; file name given to extracted patch average
 	X0	; use DO-LOOP index for picking
 	LB1	; end of DO-LOOP
 	RE	; return from batch
 
 now display series with TV M:
 
 	TV M
 	PAT	; file prefix
 	1-16	; file numbers
	<CR>	; first and last x-column numbers
	<CR>	; first and last y-row numbers
	4	; number of pictures per row
	2,2	; x and y margins
	<CR>	; default display origin
 
 
 The resulting montage will appear on the screen.  Now check for
 presence of variations. Visual check may indicate absence of
 variations. In that case, proceed by summing the image series
 to obtain the global average, and skip the next two steps.
 
 d2) In the presence of variations, proceed by running
 an MSA analysis:  The initialization operation (CA SI) accepts
 both a file series and a 3-D formatted file, so it is not
 necessary to go through the step of PS Z file extraction.
 CA SI creates a single Sequential File in which each image
 of the series is stored as a single record.
  
 Immediately after the initialization, the actual analysis is
 run.
 
 
 	CA SI	; initialize Correspondence analysis
 	AVG001	; average stack file
 	1-16	; averages to be analysed
 	MSK001	; mask file defining the pixels to be used
 	SEQ001	; name of sequential file
 	Y	; yes, all files selected exist (no gap)
	0.0	; additive constant to assure non-negativity
 	
 	CA S	; run Correspondence analysis
 	SEQ001	; sequential file created above
 	S	; stochastic version of algorithm
 	8,1	; number of factors to be used, file code
 		  The file code is attached to three generic
 		  files created in the analysis. They have
 		  the prefices IMC, PIX, and EIG. In our
 		  example, IMC001, PIX001, and EIG001 are
 		  created.
 	N	; inactive image input
 	N	; no background correction
 	0	; number of inactive images to be set inactive.
 
 
 To interpret the results, the eigenvalue histogram, factor maps, 
 and selected reconstitutions are inspected.  Printouts of the
 eigenvalue histogram and selected factor maps are created by 
 operation CA SME, which can be run interactively:
 
 	CA SME	; create factor map
 	I	; map of images
 	1,4	; file code used in CA S, no. of patches across
 	1,2	; factors to be used
 	I	; use image ID on map
 	N	; no plot file to be created
 	<CR>	; default no. of page width (1)
 	<CR>	; default no. of lines (60)
 	<CR>	; default no. of standard deviations (2.3)
 	<CR>	; default handedness of map (no flipping)
 	TITLE (up to 80 chars of title info to appear on map)
 
 The resulting eigenvalue histogram and the map selected will be
 written into the RESULTS file, and this can be printed on the
 line printer.
