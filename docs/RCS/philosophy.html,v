<dt><strong>ANSWER</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Biological macromolecules are highly susceptable to radiation
damage when exposed to the electron beam. Therefore, imaging
macromolecules using the electron microscope entails some kind of
averaging over molecule images that have been obtained with an
extremely low dose (<i>low-dose imaging</i>). For such an average
to be meaningful, the molecules must be in precisely the same
conformation and binding state.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Traditionally, to obtain multiple images of an entire ensemble
of molecules, one would use a <a href="img/particles1.jpg">crystal</a>. 
In a crystal, all molecules are in
the same conformation and binding state (as a result of high
purification that is normally a prerequisite to crystallization,
and of the highly homogeneous microenvironment of each molecule).
They are also, convenient for averaging, in the same orientation
and ordered position. X-ray crystallography makes use of the high
order, since the ordered arrangement enables the collection of
diffraction patterns. In electron microscopy, the strong
interaction of electrons with matter implies that the crystal
should be no thicker than a single layer (<i>two-dimensional
crystal</i>}.</p>

<p>Advantages of using two-D crystals:</p>

<ul>
<li>high homogeneity</li>

<li>well-developed theory of reconstruction</li>

<li>atomic resolution demonstrated for a dozen of molecules</li>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>only a single conformation or binding state, out of several
potentially important ones, is realized as a result of th e crystal
constraints;</li>
