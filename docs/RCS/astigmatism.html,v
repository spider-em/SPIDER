<h1 align="center">Astigmatism in SPIDER</h1>

<p> Astigmatism (axial): an electron-optical lens aberration that
causes the defocus to be a function of azimuth, and the contrast
transfer function to deviate from circular symmetry about the optical
axis. As a consequence, the Thon rings deform into elliptic or
hyperbolic patterns, depending on the size of defocus and the size of
the astigmatic defocus difference.  <p>

<p> As used by the Spider operations    
   <a href="man/tfc.html"> TF C</a>, 
   <a href="man/tfct.html">TF CT</a>, 
   <a href="man/tfd.html"> TF D</a>, and 
   astigmatism is a vector with magnitude and direction:  </p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Magnitude</b></dt>
<dd> The difference between the highest and lowest defocus.</dd>  
</p>

<p>
<dt><b>Angle (or azimuth)</b></dt>
<dd>The angle of the "unaffected" axis 
    (45 degrees between the low and high defocus axes)</dd>

<dd> By convention, this angle is clockwise from from the axis of 
     lowest defocus. Zero degrees is defined as the center of the 
     right hand edge of the image.  </dd>
</p>
</dl>

<!-- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx buggy diagram axis are switched!! 
Thus the following image has an astigmatism angle of
-90 degrees.  If the axis of high defocus was vertical the 
image would an astigmatism angle of -45 degrees since angles are
counter-clockwise in SPIDER.</p>
