<p>
 Although details have changed, parts of the current
 organization of the SPIDER system (in terms of procedure definitions,
 document files, registers, and symbolic parameters) go back to a
 number of brainstorms, some 40 years ago, with Brian Shimkin and
 Helen Dowse, both Computer Science students at SUNY Albany. The
 first description of SPIDER was published in the 
 Proceedings of the International Conference on Electron Microscopy 
 in Toronto, in 1978. It is reprinted 
 <a href= "./spider78.pdf">here (PDF)</a>.
