SPIDER error messages may be due to: 

<ul>

<li>An operation error during a specific operation. An 
<a href="#operation_errors">operation error message</a> will be printed. If
SPIDER is being run 
<a href= "user_doc.html#interactive">interactively</a> the user may continue
with another operation. However if SPIDER is in 
<a href="user_doc.html#batch">procedure mode</a>, the program will
terminate immediately.                                </li>

<p />

<li>A system error during the language pre-processing phase, caused
typically due to incorrect syntax being detected by the command
interpreter. A <a href="#system_errors">system error message</a>
will be printed. Below is a brief explanation as to why such an
error may have occured. Such errors are always fatal!   </li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="operation_errors">List of Operation Errors</a></h2>

Each Error Message has an associated <em>Error Number</em> from 1
to 38, except for the error message ``.SEE EXPLICIT STATEMENT''
which has an Error Number of 100. The Error Numbers and the
corresponding Error Messages are:

<h2><a name="debug">Debugging Procedure Runs</a></h2>

<p>For the debugging of procedure runs controlled by SPIDER procedure
files, it is important to know the mechanism of the procedure call.</p>

<p>Entering a SPIDER operation with the general format
@@<i>filename</i> (where filename is 256 or fewer alphanumeric
characters; e.g. @@<i>ROTAV</i>) will cause the system to look for a file
named <i>filename.projectcode</i> where projectcode is the project
code that is set upon starting SPIDER or set with the 
<a href="man/nc.html">NC</a> operation. If this file does not exist -- the
file <i>filename.sys</i> residing in the directory defined by the
system environmental variable SPPROC_DIR in the login file is used
for the procedure.</p>


If a procedure run stops unexpectedly, you should check the
RESULTS. file to see where exactly the error occurred and check
whether an error message is printed. Since file output is buffered,
the RESULTS file <em>may not</em> contain the actual final output.
The <a href="man/myfl.html">MY FL</a> operation will flush any
pending ouput to the RESULTS file. 

<p>Check the <a href="user_doc.html">User's guide</a> for a more
complete description of the SPIDER command syntax.</p>

SPIDER error messages may be due to:
<UL>
<LI>An operation error during a specific operation.  An 
   <A HREF="#operation_errors">operation error message</A> 
   will be printed. If SPIDER is being run

   <A HREF="user_doc.html#batch">procedure mode</A>,
   the program will terminate immediately. <P>

<LI>A system error during the language pre-processing phase,
   caused typically due to incorrect syntax being detected by the
  command interpreter. A

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="debug">Debugging Procedure and Pseudo-batch Runs</A></H2>
For the debugging of procedure runs controlled by
SPIDER procedure files, it is important to know the mechanism of the
procedure call.                        
<P>
Entering a SPIDER operation with the general format @@<I>filename</I>
 (where filename is 40 or fewer alphanumeric characters; e.g. @@ROTAV)
 will cause the system to
look for a file named <I>filename.projectcode</I> where projectcode is the project 
code that is set upon starting SPIDER or set with the 
<A HREF="man/nc.html">NC</A> operation. If this file does not exist -- 
the file <I>filename.sys</I>
residing in the directory defined by the system environmental variable 
SPPROC_DIR in the login file is used for the procedure. 
<P>
In the case of a procedure file, symbolic parameter references contained
in the file translated at execution-time.  Subject to substitution
are all unresolved input parameter expressions.  Take the example of a
source file called shift5.sys which has the form:
<DL><DT>
 <DD>; SHIFT5.SYS - SHIFT IMAGE BY (5,5)
 <DD><A HREF="man/fr.html">FR</A>
 <DD>?INPUT FILE? <1>
 <DD><A HREF="man/fr.html">FR</A>
 <DD>?OUTPUT FILE? <2>
 <DD><A HREF="man/sh.html">SH</A>
 <DD> <1>
 <DD> <2>
 <DD>(5,5)
 <DD><A HREF="man/re.html">RE</A>
<DT>

In this case, a calling (interactive, or procedure) sequence:

 <DD>@@SHIFT5
 <DD>PIC001
 <DD>OUT001
<DT>
will cause the file shift5.sys to be translated into the following
sequence 
 <DD><A HREF="man/sh.html">SH</A>
 <DD>PIC001
 <DD>OUT001
 <DD>(5,5)
 <DD><A HREF="man/re.html">RE</A>
 </DL>

If a procedure run stops unexpectedly, you should
check the RESULTS. file to see where exactly the error
occurred and check whether an error message is printed.  Since
file output is buffered, the RESULTS file <EM>may not</EM>
contain the actual final output.  The 
<A HREF="man/myfl.html">MY FL</A> 
operation will flush any pending ouput to the RESULTS file.
 
<P>
Check the <A HREF="user_doc.html">User's guide</A> for a 
more complete description of the SPIDER command syntax.

 (where filename is eight or fewer alphanumeric characters; e.g. @@ROTAV)
d212 1
a212 1
SPPROC_DIR in the login file is used for the brocedure. 
d214 2
a215 12
Similarly, entering a command with the general format <I>filename</I> (where
filename consists of the character 'B' for 'batch' and two digits; e.g. B09) will cause the
system to look for a file  named  <I>filename.projectcode</I>    
<P>
In both cases, a 'working copy' of the file is first produced with the
name  <I>filenameX.projectcode</I>  respectively.  
<P>
In the case of the pseudo-batch command file, the working copy is
identical with the source file.                          
<P>
In the case of a procedure command file, the working copy is an
execution-time translation of the source file.  Subject to substitution

 <DD>?INPUT FILE?
 <DD>?OUTPUT FILE?
a229 2
In this case, a calling (pseudo-batch, interactive, or procedure)
sequence:
d231 2
d237 2
a238 2
will cause the file shift5.sys to be translated into a working copy,
stored in SHIFT5X., which has the form 
d245 9
a253 8
If a pseudo-batch or procedure run stops unexpectedly, you should
first check the RESULTS. file to see where exactly the error
occurred and check whether an error message is printed. 
If this check is inconclusive, and the command file has no obvious
syntactical errors, it may be helpful to check the current working
copy using the editor. This will tell you whether or not the
run-time substitutions made by the system correspond to the expected
sequence of processing.

					<BR>ACTION: check expression
					for consistency with intended
					operation.
<P><DT> *** UNEXPECTED ERROR DURING PROCEDURE RUN
<DD>                                    A serious error condition was

<P><DT> *** UNIDENTIFIED COMMAND STRING
<DD>                                    The command string could not be
