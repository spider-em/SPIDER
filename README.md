**SPIDER**  (**S**ystem for **P**rocessing **I**mage **D**ata from **E**lectron microscopy and **R**elated fields) 
is an image processing system for electron microscopy, especially usefull for single-particle reconstruction. 
**SPIDER** has been in use since 1978 and contains 
over 210,000 lines of Fortran code and 7400 files. The [2020 release](http://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER/releases), which will probably be the 
final code update, contains new support for reading/writing MRC files.   
See the [SPIDER Github Website](https://spider-em.github.io/SPIDER)  for complete details.

* Uses:
   1. Toolkit for algorithm development.
   2. Averaging of single particles.
   3. 3D reconstruction from projections.
   4. Multivariate data analysis.
   5. Electron tomography.
   6. Object segmentation from volumes.
    
* Features:            
   1. Interactive command line interface.    
   2. Hierarchical modular design for scripting.  
   3. Graphical user interface, [*Web*](http://spider-em.github.io/Web)  
      for  visualizing and interacting with images.  
   4. Data file format interchangeable with other electron microscopy imaging systems.  
   5. Extensive documentation of  operations and techniques.                
   6. Includes source code and executables for use on Linux. 
 
* History:

   1. Originated in 1978 by  [Joachim Frank](http://joachimfranklab.org) who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering cryo-em research done at the  [Wadsworth Center](http://www.wadsworth.org) in Albany, NY.

        J. Frank, B. Shimkin, H. Dowse, D. Parsons, A. Verschoor,  L. Miranda, W. Goldfarb, S. Basu,  R. Banerjee, C. Mannella, J.P. Bretaudiere, M.V. Heel, M. Radermacher, A. Leith, J.M. Carazo, P. Penczek, S. Sibal, L. Odesanya, Y.H. Li, M. Ladjadj, Y.W. Chen, K.R. Lata, J. Zhu, W.P. Liu, B. Rath, C. Yang, B. Baxter, R. Hegerl, A. Frangakis, L. Joyeux, Z. Huang, R.J. Renka, T. Shaikh, J. Sengupta, J. LeBarron, N. Boisset, H. Gao,G. Kishchenko, J.M. Kennedy, A. Gunggong.

       In addition, SPIDER is dependent on the Fourier package [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) by M. Frigo and SG Johnson.
      
   3. SPIDER has often been used in conjunction with other software e.g. the [iterative helical real space reconstruction methods](http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033583524000155) developed by Edward H. Egelman. 
             
   4. Maintained since 2007 by: ArDean Leith & Tanvir (Tapu) Shaikh. During these 18  years they have added numerous operations, procedures, parallelizations, and over 500 pages of documentation. No significant contributors since 2007 other than Leith, Shaikh, Kischenko, and Kennedy.

  6. In 2025 we are happy to see that [citations for use of SPIDER continue](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033583524000155) in the methodology sections of significant new research publications.
